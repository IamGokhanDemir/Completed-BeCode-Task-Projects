# Azure AD DS Simplified

Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) is here to simplify your domain management in the cloud. No more worries about deploying and maintaining domain controllers. Let's dive in!

## What Is Azure AD DS?

Azure AD DS provides managed domain services:
- Domain join
- Group policy
- LDAP
- Kerberos/NTLM authentication

üöÄ **Use it without dealing with cloud domain controllers.**

## Why Use Azure AD DS?

- Perfect for running legacy apps in the cloud.
- Ideal when modern authentication isn't an option.
- Smoothly shift on-premises resources to Azure.

## How It Works

1. **Create Managed Domain**: Define a unique domain name (e.g., `aaddscontoso.com`).
2. **Replica Set**: Azure deploys 2 domain controllers as a replica set.
3. **Hands-Off Management**: No need to configure or update DCs. Azure takes care of it.
4. **Synchronization**: One-way sync from Azure AD to the managed domain.
5. **Common AD DS Features**: Apps, services, and VMs use AD DS features like domain join, group policy, LDAP, and Kerberos/NTLM auth.

## Features and Benefits

- **Simplified Deployment**: Enabled through the Azure Portal.
- **Integration with Azure AD**: User info syncs automatically.
- **Corporate Credentials**: Same passwords for users.
- **NTLM and Kerberos Auth**: Legacy apps? No problem!
- **High Availability**: Multiple domain controllers.
- **Geographical Disaster Recovery**: Multiple replica sets for resilience.

## Key Aspects

- Stand-alone domain, not an extension of on-premises.
- IT team-free: No need to manage, patch, or monitor domain controllers.
- Seamless integration with Azure AD, whether cloud-only or synchronized with on-premises AD DS.

üëâ **Azure AD DS extends central identity use cases to traditional web applications running in Azure.**

Now you're Azure AD DS-ready! üöÄ
