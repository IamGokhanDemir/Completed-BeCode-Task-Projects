## What is Offensive security?

💡 **Offensive security** is like being a 🕵️ digital detective or 💻 hacker. It involves exploring computer systems, software, and apps to find hidden vulnerabilities and 🚪 loopholes. These weaknesses can act as secret doors that grant unauthorized access to sensitive information. 🕵️‍♂️ Offensive security experts use their skills to uncover and exploit these weaknesses, similar to solving a puzzle or playing a high-tech game. 

🚫⛔ However, it's important to note that engaging in offensive security activities without proper authorization is illegal and can result in serious consequences. The term offensive security describes the process of searching for and exploiting these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access. 🔒🔓

## Tools 

### gobuster:

🔍 **Gobuster** is a tool used in the field of cybersecurity, particularly in the area of penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. It is designed to help security professionals and ethical hackers discover hidden directories and files on web servers.

🔎 Gobuster works by sending HTTP requests to a target web server and analyzing the server's responses. It systematically tries different directory and file names, attempting to find paths that are not explicitly linked or easily accessible. This process is commonly known as **directory/file brute-forcing**.

🚀 By using Gobuster, cybersecurity experts can uncover hidden or forgotten directories, sensitive files, and potential security vulnerabilities on a web server. This information is crucial for assessing the overall security posture of a website or application and helps organizations identify and fix potential weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors.

💡 It's important to note that Gobuster should only be used on systems and websites for which you have proper authorization. Unauthorized use of Gobuster or any other similar tools can be illegal and may have serious consequences. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions and legal rights before conducting any security assessments.

🔍 **What is Gobuster?**

Gobuster is a powerful tool used for **web enumeration and directory/file brute-forcing**. It helps in identifying hidden directories and files on a web server by systematically searching for them.

🔎 **Examples of Gobuster Usage**

1. 📂 **Discovering Hidden Directories:**
   ```
   gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w common.txt
   ```
   🚀 Use Gobuster to search for common directories (-u) on the specified URL (http://example.com) using a wordlist (-w). 

2. 📄 **Brute-Forcing File Names:**
   ```
   gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w common_files.txt -x php,txt
   ```
   🔐 Use Gobuster to search for common files (-u) on the specified URL (http://example.com) using a wordlist (-w) and specific file extensions (-x).

3. ✏️ **Using Custom Wordlists:**
   ```
   gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w custom.txt
   ```
   📝 Use Gobuster to search for directories (-u) on the specified URL (http://example.com) using a custom wordlist (-w).

4. ⚙️ **Adjusting Speed and Request Rate:**
   ```
   gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w common.txt -z 10
   ```
   ⏳ Use Gobuster to add a delay of 10 milliseconds between requests (-z) to avoid overwhelming the target server.

⚠️ **Remember to Use Gobuster Responsibly!**

Ensure you have **proper authorization** from the owner of the target system or website before conducting any security assessments. Using Gobuster without permission can have legal consequences.
