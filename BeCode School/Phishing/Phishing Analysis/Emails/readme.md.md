# Phishing Analysis Challenge

## Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to my Phishing Analysis Challenge repository. In this exciting journey, I will take you through my experience and learnings while tackling the task of analyzing suspicious emails and detecting phishing attempts. So, buckle up and let's dive right into it!

## What I Learned

Throughout this challenge, I had the opportunity to enhance my skills as a SOC analyst and sharpen my understanding of phishing detection. Here are some key learnings I gained during this adventure:

- **Email Analysis**: I delved into the world of email analysis, exploring techniques to examine email headers, content, and attachments for signs of phishing activity.
- **Phishing Fundamentals**: Prior to starting the challenge, I completed two informative TryHackMe rooms, [Phishing Emails 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails1tryoe) and [Phishing Emails 2](https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails2rytmuv). These rooms provided me with a solid foundation in recognizing phishing techniques and understanding email analysis.
- **Phishtool**: Throughout the challenge, I heavily relied on the powerful tool called Phishtool. This comprehensive platform enabled me to respond to phishing incidents effectively and gather valuable threat intelligence. By utilizing Phishtool, I was able to identify and assess potential phishing attacks with greater accuracy and efficiency.

## Phishtool: An Overview

Phishtool is an invaluable resource for SOC analysts like myself. It combines threat intelligence, open-source intelligence (OSINT), email metadata analysis, and automatic analysis pathways into a single, robust platform. With Phishtool, I gained a significant advantage in combatting phishing campaigns that might otherwise have gone undetected.

## Defanging: An Essential Technique

During the challenge, I learned about the concept of defanging, which is crucial when dealing with potentially malicious content like IP addresses, URLs, or domains. Defanging involves modifying the format of these elements to prevent accidental interaction or execution.

For example, let's consider the domain `example[dot]com`. By replacing the period (.) with `[dot]`, we defang the domain to ensure it does not function as an actual hyperlink. This technique helps mitigate the risks associated with handling potentially harmful content.

## Conclusion

Embarking on this Phishing Analysis Challenge has been an incredible journey of growth and learning. I developed a deeper understanding of email analysis, leveraged the power of Phishtool, and mastered the technique of defanging to enhance security measures. I am confident that these newfound skills will enable me to better detect and respond to phishing attempts in the future.
