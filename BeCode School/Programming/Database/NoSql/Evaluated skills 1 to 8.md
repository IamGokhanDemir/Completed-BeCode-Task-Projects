- [x] They can be automatically generated by the DBMS when a new record is inserted.
- [x] They serve as unique identifiers of a record in a table.
- [ ] A primary key that has no foreign keys linked to it results in an orphan record.

**Question 5**
Foreign keys should always link back to what?

- [x] Prevent a delete operation on a foreign key field if the primary key value exists.

- [x] Prevent an insert operation on a primary key field if an identical primary key already exists.
- [ ] Prevent an insert operation on a foreign key field if an identical primary key already exists.

**Question 11**
What criteria must be met for a database to be in second normal form (2NF)?

- [ ] The database must have been designed in 2NF from the beginning.
- [x] All partial dependencies must be removed.
- [x] All transitive dependencies must be removed.
- [x] The database must also be in 1NF.
- [ ] The database must also be in 3NF.

**Question 12**
The Pets table below represents your current database design:

PetID | Name | Species | OwnerID | OwnerLastName | OwnerFirstName 
---|---|---|---|---|---
123 | Huey | Duck | 987 | Washington | George
124 | Duey | Duck | 987 | Washington | George
125 | Luey | Duck | 987 | Washington | George

You want to normalize the database to 3NF. Which of the following would be a successful normalization to 3NF?

- [ ] Pet information: PetID, Name, SpeciesID, BreedID, OwnerID
- [ ] Pets (PK) PetName, SpeciesID, OwnerFullName
- [x] Pets (PK) PetID, Name, (FK) SpeciesID, (FK) OwnerID
