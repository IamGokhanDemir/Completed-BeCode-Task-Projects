## Features of a Database Management System (DBMS)

### 🛠️ **Role of DBMS** 🛠️

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is an encompassing system that manages your database. It acts as an intermediary between users and the data it stores.

What does that mean?

The DBMS isn't the database itself. Instead, it's software that allows users to access the database and its components. It ensures security and handles the maintenance of objects like tables within the database. The term "database" often refers to what's inside the DBMS.

Examples of DBMS: SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.

### 💡 **Common DBMS Features** 💡

DBMS comprises objects like tables, stored procedures, triggers, views, synonyms, and security measures.

It also holds the logic for retrieving and manipulating data based on executed SQL. Users need not worry about data retrieval logic; the DBMS manages it. Security features include user passwords and access levels to data and structures.

Another feature is scheduling and running jobs at specific times, usually off-peak hours, for tasks like data backup or daily transactions.

### ⏰ **Automating with Jobs** ⏰

A job automates running SQL statements, stored procedures, or pre-written SQL code at specific intervals. For instance, data backup or transfer tasks. Options can notify recipients of job status (fail/succeed/complete), freeing administrators from manual execution.

### 🗄️ **Choosing a DBMS** 🗄️

Factors like personal experience, cost, functionality, and data size influence the DBMS choice. Small-medium data volumes suit open-source options, while subscription/license-based systems like SQL Server or Oracle handle larger-scale data better.

Consider future organizational needs when selecting. Open-source options like MariaDB and PostgreSQL may be cost-effective, while licensed ones offer user support.
