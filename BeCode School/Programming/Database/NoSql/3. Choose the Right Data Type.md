## Storing Data in Tables: Understanding Data Types

### 📚 **Data Type Basics** 📚

**Data types** define how data is stored in attributes. They include numbers, date/time, boolean, and text. Choosing the right data type is crucial for accurate calculations.

### 🔢 **Numeric Data Types** 🔢

Numeric fields store numeric values. They can hold integers or decimals. Integer fields hold whole numbers, while decimal fields allow defining decimal points.

### ⚖️ **Integers vs. Decimals** ⚖️

Integers store whole numbers, while decimals store numeric values with decimal points. Entering decimals in an integer field can lead to rounding.

### 📅 **Date/Time Data Types** 📅

Date/time fields hold various formats for dates or times, or both. They're essential for accurate date-based calculations like age or service length.

### ✅ **Boolean Data Types** ✅

Boolean fields are for yes/no answers. They provide a straightforward way to handle binary choices.

### ❓ **Boolean vs. Numeric** ❓

While you could use numeric fields for yes/no (0/1) choices, boolean fields are clearer and avoid confusion over numeric values.

### 📝 **Text Data Types** 📝

Text fields are for storing character data. SQL Server's varchar() allows specifying character limits, e.g., varchar(100) for 100 characters.

### 📊 **Specific Data Types Usage** 📊

Experienced developers choose data types based on data requirements. Date/time fields ensure accurate date calculations, while text fields accept various data types.

### 📝 **Detailed Data Types** 📝

SQL Server offers specific data types:

- **Date:** Records only the date.
- **Time:** Records only the time.
- **Datetime:** Records both date and time.
- **Time data type:** Suitable for recording process durations.
- **Date data type:** Useful for capturing events like birthdays.

### 📏 **Specifying Data Limits** 📏

Data types like varchar() allow specifying character limits. Others include binary, which defines data size.

### 🌐 **Images and Text Fields** 🌐

While images can be saved in databases, it's better to save them externally due to size. Store image links in text fields.
