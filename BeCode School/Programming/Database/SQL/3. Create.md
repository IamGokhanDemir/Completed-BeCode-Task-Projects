## SQL Lesson 13: Inserting rows

🧠🌟 Welcome to the world of inserting data into a database using SQL! Let's explore this magical process together! 🏰✨

**What is a Schema?** 📚🔍
Before we continue, let's understand what a "Schema" means. Think of it as a blueprint for a house! 🏠✨ Just like a blueprint tells you how rooms should be structured, a database schema describes how tables should be organized and what types of data each column can hold. For example, the "Movies" table's schema ensures that "Year" column only holds whole numbers (Integers) and "Title" column stores text (Strings).

**Inserting New Data** 📥💾
Now, let's learn how to add new data into the database using the INSERT statement! It's like adding new treasures to a treasure chest! 🗝💎

**Case 1: Inserting Values for All Columns** 🗒️✏️
When you have data for all columns in the table, you can use this spell:
```sql
INSERT INTO mytable
VALUES (value1, value2, ...),
       (value1_2, value2_2, ...),
       ...;
```
It allows you to add multiple rows at once! Just like filling rows in a table one by one! 🎉

**Case 2: Inserting Specific Columns** 📑✒️
If you don't have all the data, no worries! You can specify the columns you have data for:
```sql
INSERT INTO mytable
(column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...),
      (value1_2, value2_2, ...),
      ...;
```
Even if some columns have default values, this spell keeps things smooth! It's like adding missing pieces to complete a puzzle! 🧩✨

**Magical Expressions** 🔮🎩
You can use magical expressions with the values you insert! It's like transforming numbers and text to fit perfectly into the table! 🌟🔢

Example:
```sql
INSERT INTO boxoffice
(movie_id, rating, sales_in_millions)
VALUES (1, 9.9, 283742034 / 1000000);
```
In this example, we're dividing a big number to fit into the "sales_in_millions" column! It's like making the data fit just right! 🎯💫

Now, you possess the knowledge to add new data into a database with the power of SQL! 🎓💪 Go forth and fill your database with wonderful information! You're becoming a true database master! 🧙‍♂️💻✨
