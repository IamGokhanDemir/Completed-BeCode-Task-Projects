The goal of this level is to log into the game. Follow these steps to achieve this goal:

1. Obtain the initial credentials via the [Exercise Powershell](link) channel on our Slack. Once you are in the channel, scroll to the top to see the credentials.

2. After obtaining the credentials, connect to the server via SSH. You will need an SSH client such as Putty. The host you will be connecting to is `century.underthewire.tech` on port 22.

3. When prompted, use the credentials for the applicable game found in the [[Exercise Powershell]] Slack channel.

4. You have successfully connected to the game server when your path changes to `PS C:\Users\Century1\desktop>`.
