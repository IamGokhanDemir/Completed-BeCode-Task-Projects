## **üö´ Data Loss Prevention: Safeguarding Sensitive Information**

Protecting sensitive data is paramount to an organization's integrity. Microsoft Purview's **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** tools are here to help! Let's unravel the essence of DLP in a simple and memorable way.

### **1. What is Data Loss Prevention (DLP)?** üõ°Ô∏è

DLP is a strategy to prevent sensitive information from being accidentally shared or exposed. Admins can use DLP policies to:

- **Identify, Monitor, and Protect:** Sensitive data across Microsoft 365, including OneDrive, SharePoint, Teams, and Exchange.
- **Educate Users:** Notify users about compliance during their workflow, ensuring smooth integration.
- **View DLP Reports:** Understand how well DLP policies are being followed with real-time reporting.

### **2. DLP Policies: The Core** ‚öñÔ∏è

DLP policies work through:

- **Conditions:** These define what content triggers the policy.
- **Actions:** Specify automatic steps when matching content is found.
- **Locations:** Determine where the policy is applied (Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, etc.).

For instance, a DLP policy can spot sensitive credit card numbers in OneDrive, blocking their unauthorized sharing.

¬†The diagram below shows how multiple rules, each with their own conditions and actions, are grouped into a single policy.

### **3. Endpoint Data Loss Prevention (Endpoint DLP)** üíª

Endpoint DLP extends protection to:

- Windows 10, Windows 11, macOS devices (Catalina 10.15 and higher).
- Audit and control user activities on sensitive content, like creating, renaming, copying, printing, and more.

Activity Explorer helps admins enforce protective actions based on user behavior.

In the activity explorer, you can view information about what users are doing with sensitive content:

Admins use this information to enforce protective actions for content through controls and policies.
### **4. DLP in Microsoft Teams** üí¨

DLP now safeguards Microsoft Teams as well! Admins can create policies to prevent sharing sensitive info in Teams chats and channels, ensuring secure collaboration. Policy tips notify users about policy triggers, enabling compliance-aligned collaboration.
¬†For example, the screenshot below shows a policy tip on a chat message that was blocked because the user attempted to share a U.S. Social Security Number:

The user can then find out more about why their message was blocked by selecting the "What can I do?" link, and take appropriate action:

With DLP policies, Microsoft Teams can help users across organizations to collaborate securely and in a way that's in line with compliance requirements.
