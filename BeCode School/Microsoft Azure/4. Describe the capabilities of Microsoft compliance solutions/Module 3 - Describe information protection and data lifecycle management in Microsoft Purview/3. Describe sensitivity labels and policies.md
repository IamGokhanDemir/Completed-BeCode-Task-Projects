## **üîí Unveiling Data Protection: Sensitivity Labels and Policies**

In today's data-driven era, data protection is paramount for organizations to uphold customer trust, ensure business continuity, and comply with regulations. Microsoft Purview's **Sensitivity Labels and Policies** offer robust tools to safeguard data. Let's dive into this subject in a simple and memorable way!

### **1. Sensitivity Labels** üè∑Ô∏è

Think of **Sensitivity Labels** as stamps for digital content. They enable organizations to:

- **Customize Labels:** Create categories like **Public**, **Confidential**, and **Highly Confidential** tailored to your organization's needs.
- **Clear Text:** Labels are stored as clear text, allowing third-party apps to apply further protective actions.
- **Persistent Protection:** Labels stay with content, even when shared, forming the basis for enforcing policies.

Remember: One content item gets one label.

### **2. Sensitivity Labels Configurations** ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Encryption:** Secure emails or both emails and documents.
- **Marking:** Add watermarks, headers, or footers to Office apps.
- **Automatic Labeling:** Labels can be applied automatically or recommended, even in Office apps.
- **Container Protection:** Secure content in containers like sites and groups.
- **Third-Party Apps:** Extend sensitivity labels to other apps using the Microsoft Purview Information Protection SDK.
- **Classification without Protection:** Classify content for reports and tracking without applying protection settings.

### **3. Label Policies** üìú

**Label Policies** bring Sensitivity Labels to life:

- **User Visibility:** Choose users and groups who can access labels.
- **Default Label:** Apply default labels to new content, which users can change if needed.
- **Justifications:** Users must explain label changes, ensuring accountability.
- **Mandatory Labeling:** Force labels before content creation.
- **Custom Help Pages:** Link users to understand label meanings.

Once a label is applied, its protection settings are enforced.
