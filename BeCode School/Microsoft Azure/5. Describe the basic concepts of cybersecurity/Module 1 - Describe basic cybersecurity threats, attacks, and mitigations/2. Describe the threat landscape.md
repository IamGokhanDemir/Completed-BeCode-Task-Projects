## **üîí Understanding the Threat Landscape**

In the realm of cybersecurity, comprehending the threat landscape is vital to defending against cyberattacks. Let's explore key concepts like attack vectors, security breaches, and more.

### **üåê What's the Threat Landscape?**

- The **threat landscape** encompasses all potential entry points for cyberattacks in an organization's digital interactions.
- Includes email and social media accounts, mobile devices, tech infrastructure, cloud services, and even people.
- Not limited to computers; covers all elements managed or unmanaged by an organization.

### **üöÄ Attack Vectors: Entry Points**

- **Attack vectors** are routes attackers use to infiltrate systems.
- Common vectors include:
   - **Email**: Cybercriminals send seemingly legitimate emails prompting user actions.
   - **Wireless Networks**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in devices connected to unsecured networks.
   - **Social Media Accounts**: Monitoring or exploiting data from these accounts.
   - **Physical Devices**: Malicious USB drives or media to compromise devices.
   - **Browsers**: Manipulating websites or extensions to compromise devices.
   - **Cloud Services**: Exploiting poorly secured cloud resources.
   - **Insiders**: Unauthorized access by employees or impersonation attacks.

### **üîê Security Breaches: Unauthorized Access**

- A **security breach** occurs when unauthorized access is gained to devices, services, or networks.
- Can be a result of exploiting vulnerabilities, social engineering, or impersonation.
- Security breaches include various forms:
   - **Social Engineering Attacks**: Manipulating users to grant unauthorized access.
   - **Browser Attacks**: Exploiting browser vulnerabilities to compromise devices.
   - **Password Attacks**: Attempting to guess or crack passwords.
   - **Data Breaches**: Successfully accessing or controlling data.
