## **üîë Authentication: Proving Identity**

Authentication is a crucial process in cybersecurity that verifies the identity of a user or entity before granting access to resources. Similar to presenting identification at a physical store, digital authentication ensures that only authorized users gain entry. In this unit, we'll explore the different authentication methods and their importance in cybersecurity.

### **üîê Types of Authentication:**

- **Something You Know:**
  - Passwords: Common but can be weak if too simple.
  - PIN Numbers: Used for secure access, like ATMs.
  - Security Questions: Provide answers to predefined questions.
  
- **Something You Have:**
  - Identity Cards: Physical cards issued as identification.
  - USB Keys: Portable devices used for secure access.
  - Smartphones/Devices: Used for mobile authentication.
  
- **Something You Are (Biometric):**
  - Fingerprint: Unique patterns of ridges and valleys.
  - Facial Recognition: Analyzes facial features.
  - Retinal Scan: Captures unique retina patterns.

### **üîë Single-Factor Authentication:**

- Uses only one type of authentication.
- Examples: Password, PIN, Biometric alone.
- Convenient but less secure due to single layer.

### **üîê Multifactor Authentication (MFA):**

- Uses two or more types of authentication.
- Example: Password + Phone verification.
- Enhances security by requiring multiple proofs.
- Common for accessing sensitive data, online banking, etc.

### **üîë The Importance of Multifactor Authentication:**

- MFA significantly enhances security.
- Combines various authentication methods.
- Reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access.
- Should be the default approach for important accounts.

## **üîë Practice Questions:**

   - [ ] To encrypt data during transmission.
   - [ ] To prove the authenticity of a digital certificate.
   - [x] To verify the identity of a user or entity.
   - [ ] To ensure the confidentiality of messages.

**2. Which of the following is an example of "something you have" authentication?**
   - [ ] A PIN number.
   - [x] A fingerprint scan.
   - [ ] A security question.
   - [ ] A password.

**3. Why is multifactor authentication (MFA) considered more secure than single-factor authentication?**
   - [ ] MFA uses longer passwords.
   - [ ] MFA requires complex encryption.
   - [x] MFA combines multiple types of authentication.
