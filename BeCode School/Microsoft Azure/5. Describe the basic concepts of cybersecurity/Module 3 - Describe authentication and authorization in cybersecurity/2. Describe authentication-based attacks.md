## Authentication-Based Attacks

Authentication is the gatekeeper of cybersecurity, but attackers often try to sneak past. Let's dive into common attacks:

### 1. 🔑 Brute Force Attack
- **Attack:** Repeatedly trying different credentials.
- **Goal:** Guess the right combo to gain access.
- **Target:** Simple passwords, single-factor authentication.

### 2. 🔑 Dictionary Attack
- **Attack:** Using common words as passwords.
- **Goal:** Exploiting weak password choices.
- **Prevention:** Use complex passwords with symbols.

### 3. 🔑 Credential Stuffing
- **Attack:** Using stolen credentials on multiple accounts.
- **Goal:** Exploiting password reuse.
- **Prevention:** Avoid reusing passwords, change them often.

### 4. 🔑 Keylogging
- **Attack:** Malware recording keystrokes.
- **Goal:** Capturing usernames and passwords.
- **Prevention:** Avoid untrusted software, use reliable antivirus.

### 5. 🔑 Social Engineering
- **Attack:** Exploiting human weaknesses.
- **Methods:** Phishing, Pretexting, Baiting, etc.
- **Prevention:** Train users, employ multifactor authentication.

### Social Engineering Techniques
- **Phishing:** Fake emails with malicious links.
- **Spear Phishing:** Targeting specific individuals.
- **Pretexting:** Gaining trust to extract information.
- **Baiting:** Offering fake rewards.

### Keep Secure:
- 🧠 **Educate Users:** Train them to spot attacks.
- 🔐 **MFA:** Use multiple authentication methods.
- 🔄 **Keep Updated:** Keep software up to date.
- 🔒 **Strong Passwords:** Use unique complex passwords.
