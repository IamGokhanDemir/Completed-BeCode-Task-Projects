## **🔒 Hashing and Digital Signatures: Ensuring Data Integrity**

Hashing and digital signatures play a crucial role in verifying data integrity and authenticity. Let's delve into what hashing is, its application in digital signing, and how it ensures the security of digital documents.

### **🔐 What is Hashing?**

- Hashing converts data into a unique fixed-length value using a hashing algorithm.
- Same data will always produce the same hash value.
- Hashing is irreversible, and hash values cannot be decrypted back to the original data.

### **🔑 Digital Signature and Hashing**

- Digital signatures validate the authenticity and integrity of digital documents.
- Digital signatures use asymmetric key pairs (private and public keys).
- A time-stamped hash is created for the document to ensure it hasn't changed.

### **🔒 How Digital Signatures Work**

1. **Creating a Digital Signature:**
   - Monica assigns a digital signature to a document using her private key.
   - The document's hash is encrypted with Monica's private key.
   - The encrypted hash is appended to the original document.

2. **Verifying the Digital Signature:**
   - Victoria receives the digitally signed document and extracts Monica's hash.
   - Victoria generates a new hash for the original document.
   - Monica's encrypted hash is decrypted using her public key.
   - If the decrypted hash matches Victoria's hash, the signature is valid.

### **🖋 Digital Signing Services**

- Digital signing services like DocuSign and Adobe Sign facilitate secure digital signatures.
- These services ensure the authenticity and integrity of signed documents.
