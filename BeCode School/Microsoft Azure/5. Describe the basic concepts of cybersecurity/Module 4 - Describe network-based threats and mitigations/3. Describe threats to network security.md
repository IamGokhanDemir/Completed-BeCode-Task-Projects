## **Guarding Against Network Threats** 🛡️

Our interconnected world thrives on networks. But this very interconnectedness makes them tempting targets for cybercriminals. Let's uncover the common threats and how to tackle them.

### **1. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack** 👤

- Cybercriminals intercept network data, like sneaky eavesdroppers.
- They compromise or mimic network routes, intercepting information.
- Imagine someone wiretapping your conversations, but digitally.

### **2. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack** 🌐🔥

- Attackers overload networks with simultaneous requests.
- This onslaught crashes the network or service's availability.
- Think of it as a digital traffic jam causing chaos.

### **DNS Attacks: Fragile Foundations** 🕳️

- DNS servers lack security focus, making them vulnerable.
- DNS poisoning diverts traffic to malicious sites.
- Attackers play with the traffic signs, leading you astray.

### **Wireless Network Assaults** 📶🚫

- Wireless networks are like open doors for devices.
- Wardriving: Attackers hunt unsecured networks, using them for illegal activities.
- Spoofing: Bogus access points trick you into unsafe connections.

### **Bluetooth Beware** 🎧🔵

- Bluetooth devices are increasingly common.
- Bluejacking: Unsolicited messages annoy or trick nearby Bluetooth devices.
- The attacker needs close proximity – like a digital doorbell ditcher.

## Video Animation

In this short video, you'll see a simulation of how each of these attacks works. For the man-in-the-middle attack, to keep it simple, we've chosen to only use one route. With the DDoS attack, hundreds of thousands, or even tens of millions, of computers are used. Again, for simplicity, we'll only show a handful: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RWP56P?postJsllMsg=true
