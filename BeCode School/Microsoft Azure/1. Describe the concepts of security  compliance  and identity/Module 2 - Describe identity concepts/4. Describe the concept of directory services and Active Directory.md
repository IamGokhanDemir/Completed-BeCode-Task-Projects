üåê **What's a Directory?**

## Active Directory (AD): The Network Organizer

ü™Ñ **Active Directory (AD)** is a powerful tool created by Microsoft. It's like the master organizer of a big event. One of its star services is **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**. This service keeps track of all the important folks in the network: devices and users. It also checks if they're really who they say they are and decides what they can do.

üíº **Domain Controller (DC)**: Imagine the AD DS as a wizard and the Domain Controller as its magical helper. The DC is a server that makes sure everything is running smoothly in the AD world.

üè¢ **For Traditional Networks**: AD DS is awesome for old-school networks with a bunch of computers in one place. It lets you manage lots of things using a single magic key.

‚ö° **But Wait, There's More!**

üåê **Enter the Cloud**: The internet is like a cloud that's part of our lives. People use mobiles, work from different places, and use all sorts of apps. The traditional AD can't handle this well.

üåü **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**: This is like the superhero version of AD. It's designed for the modern world, where people use all kinds of devices and apps from anywhere. It makes sure everyone can use stuff securely, whether in the cloud or on their own computer.
