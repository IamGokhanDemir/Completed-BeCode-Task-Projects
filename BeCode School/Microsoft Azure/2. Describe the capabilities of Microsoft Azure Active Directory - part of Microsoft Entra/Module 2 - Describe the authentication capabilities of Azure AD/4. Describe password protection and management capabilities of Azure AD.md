## üîí Password Protection and Management in Azure AD

Password Protection is like a shield for your Azure AD identity. It prevents weak passwords from becoming an open door to attackers. Let's explore how it works and how you can level up your password security game:

### Default Protection üõ°Ô∏è

- **Global Banned List**: Azure AD automatically blocks known weak passwords, like "P@$$w0rd".
- **Variation Blocking**: Even tricky variations (like P@ssw0rd) are stopped.
- **Smart Fuzzy-Matching**: Detects patterns resembling weak passwords.
- **Notification System**: Users are nudged to choose stronger passwords.

### Custom Security üöÄ

- **Custom Banned Lists**: Admins create lists to ban org-specific passwords.
  - Brands, products, locations, internal terms - it's up to you.
- **Combined Power**: Custom list + Global list = Ironclad protection.

### Preventing Attacks üõ°Ô∏è

- **Password Spray Defense**: Foils attacks trying common passwords on many accounts.
- **Real-World Data**: Uses Azure AD insights to build its defenses.
- **Hybrid Harmony**: Integrates with on-premises AD for consistent protection.

Remember, while Password Protection is fantastic, don't rely solely on passwords. Layer up with Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication for a robust fortress of security!
