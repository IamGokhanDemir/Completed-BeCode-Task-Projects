## üöÄ **Azure Identity Protection: Safeguarding Identities**

Azure Identity Protection empowers organizations with powerful tools to defend against identity-based risks and strengthen security. It encompasses a trio of essential functions:

### **1. Automating Risk Detection and Remediation:**

- **Automated Detection**: Leverage Microsoft's vast data analysis, processing 6.5 trillion signals daily, to pinpoint potential threats across Azure AD, Microsoft Accounts, and Xbox.
  
- **Signal Integration**: Signals flow into Identity Protection, supporting tools like Conditional Access for access decisions and SIEM tools like Microsoft Sentinel for further analysis.

### **2. Investigation and Analysis:**

- **Risk Categorization**: Identity Protection classifies risks into low, medium, and high tiers, providing actionable insights.

- **Sign-In Risk Calculation**: Calculate real-time or offline sign-in risk, assessing the probability of unauthorized authentication requests.

- **Sign-In Risks**: Identify risks like anonymous IP addresses, atypical travel patterns, malware-linked IP addresses, unfamiliar sign-in locations, and password spray attacks.

- **User Identity Risks**: Detect risks such as leaked credentials, leveraging internal and external threat intelligence sources.

### **3. Reporting and Response:**

- **Investigative Reports**: Access three critical reports - risky users, risky sign-ins, and risk detections - for in-depth risk analysis.

- **Automated Remediation**: Implement automated remediation actions via risk policies to ensure swift response and protection.

- **Azure AD Premium P2**: Identity Protection is available as part of Azure AD Premium P2, offering advanced identity security.
