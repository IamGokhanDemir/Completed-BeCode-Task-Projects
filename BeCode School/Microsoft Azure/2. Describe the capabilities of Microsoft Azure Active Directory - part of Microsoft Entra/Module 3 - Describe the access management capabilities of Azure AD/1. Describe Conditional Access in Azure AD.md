### Creating Policies üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- **Policy Creation**: Azure AD admin crafts policies for secure access.
- **Signals Analysis**: Considers user, location, device, app, and risk signals.
- **Automated Decisions**: Policies decide who can access resources.
### Key Signals üì∂

- **User & Groups**: Policies can target specific users or groups.
- **Location Info**: Define rules based on named location or even country/region.
- **Device Platform**: Certain platforms or device states can trigger policies.
- **Application Focus**: Different apps can have different access rules.
- **Real-time Risk Detection**: Signals from Azure AD Identity Protection help identify risky behavior.

### Access Control üö™

- **Block Access**: Deny entry.
- **Grant Access**: Permission granted.
- **Extra Verification**: Conditions like multi-factor auth, device compliance, and more.
- **Session Controls**: Limit experiences in cloud apps based on conditions.
- **Custom Control**: Options like password change, app protection policies, and more.

### Focus Areas üîç

- **User Risk**: Evaluate the probability of compromised identities.
- **Group or Guest Targeting**: Policies can be aimed at specific groups or guests.
- **Paid Azure AD Editions**: Available for enhanced security tiers.

Remember, Conditional Access isn't a DoS defense, but a robust layer for secure access. Combine with other security measures for ultimate protection!
