# üåê Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark and Azure Security Baselines

## üìä Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB)

The **Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB)** is your compass to securing cloud deployments in Azure and the multicloud realm. It offers prescriptive best practices and recommendations to enhance the security of workloads, data, and services. Peek at it on GitHub as the Microsoft_cloud_security_benchmark : https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Microsoft%20Cloud%20Security%20Benchmark (it's an Excel sheet!).

**Key Components of MCSB V1**:

- **ID**: Unique identifiers for each recommendation.
- **Control Domain**: High-level descriptors of features needing attention, like network security, data protection, etc.
- **Mapping to Industry Frameworks**: Aligns with frameworks like CIS, NIST, and PCI DSS for seamless security and compliance.
- **Recommendation**: Specific guidance for control domains, aiding secure practices.
- **Security Principle**: Explains the "what" for controls.
- **Azure Guidance**: Delves into "how" for Azure implementation.
- **AWS Guidance**: Detailed AWS-specific implementation instructions.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Baselines for Azure

**Security baselines** are standardized documents defining security capabilities and optimal configurations for Azure offerings. They empower you to fortify security via enhanced tooling, tracking, and features.

**Key Aspects**:

- **Content Grouping**: Arranged according to control domains from MCSB.
- **Control ID**: Corresponds to MCSB recommendations.
- **Feature**: Security functionalities to fulfill control needs.
- **Feature Description**: Explains the feature's role in the product offering.
- **Supported**: Indicates feature support for security.
- **Enabled by Default**: Shows if a feature is enabled in Microsoft's default deployment.
- **Configuration Responsibility**: Specifies who implements the configuration.
- **Configuration Guidance**: Step-by-step instructions for implementing configurations.
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Monitoring Note**: Pertains to Microsoft Defender for Cloud policy/monitoring. Omitted if not monitored.
