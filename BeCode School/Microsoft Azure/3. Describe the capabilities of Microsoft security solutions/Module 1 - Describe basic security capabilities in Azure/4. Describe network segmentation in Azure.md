## üîí Secure Your Network with Azure Network Segmentation

Network segmentation involves dividing an organization's network into smaller, isolated segments, just like different departments have separate office spaces. In the world of corporate IT networks, segmentation has several key purposes:

### üìä Reasons for Network Segmentation:

1. **Grouping Assets**: Group assets supporting similar operations together, enhancing organization and management.

2. **Isolation of Resources**: Keep resources separate for security and privacy, reducing the risk of lateral movement in case of a breach.

3. **Governance Compliance**: Meet organizational policies and regulatory requirements effectively.

4. **Zero Trust Approach**: Support the Zero Trust model by containing attackers and minimizing potential breaches.

### üõ°Ô∏è Azure Virtual Network (VNet):

Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is your private network foundation in Azure. It's like your traditional network but with Azure's scalability and availability benefits.

Key VNet Features:

- **Segmentation**: Divide your network into multiple VNets, each containing smaller subnets for controlled communication.
- **Isolation**: Resources within a VNet are isolated by default, allowing explicit communication setup as needed.
- **Secure Communication**: Enhance control over how Azure resources communicate with each other, on-premises networks, and the internet.
