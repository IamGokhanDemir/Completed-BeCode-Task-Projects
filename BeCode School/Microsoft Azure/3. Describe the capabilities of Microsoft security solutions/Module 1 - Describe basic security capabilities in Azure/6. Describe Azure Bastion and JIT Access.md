# üõ°Ô∏è Azure Bastion and JIT Access: Strengthening Remote Access Security

## üåê The Need for Secure Remote Access:

You've fortified your Azure resources with Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall, but now your remote developers and data scientists need direct access to virtual machines (VMs). Exposing RDP or SSH ports to the internet is risky due to potential vulnerabilities and attacks.

## üõ°Ô∏è Azure Bastion: The Secure Bridge

- **What**: Azure Bastion, a platform-managed PaaS service.
- **How**: Connects to VMs via RDP/SSH through the Azure portal.
- **Protection**: No public IP, no NSGs hassle, secure TLS connection.
- **Benefits**: Protection against port scanning, centralized hardening.

## üèõÔ∏è Azure Bastion Deployment:

- Per virtual network with support for virtual network peering.
- Available for all VMs in the VNet and peered VNets.

## üöÄ Key Features of Azure Bastion:

1. Direct RDP and SSH: One-click access in Azure portal.
2. TLS and Firewall Traversal: Secure connection via TLS.
3. No Public IP: Uses private IP on VM, no exposure.
4. Managed PaaS: No NSG management, fully secured.
5. Port Scanning Protection: Shield from external threats.
6. Zero-day Exploit Defense: Always updated and secured.

## üõë Just-in-Time (JIT) Access: Reducing Attack Surface

- Inbound traffic to VMs is locked down.
- Select ports for inbound traffic blocking.
- Defender for Cloud enforces "deny all inbound traffic" rules.
- Access requires Azure RBAC permissions.
- Temporary inbound access is granted and revoked.
- Existing rules take priority.

## üîê Strengthening Security: Azure Bastion + JIT Access

- Azure Bastion provides secure remote access.
- JIT Access reduces exposure to attack surface.
- Together, a robust and secure remote access solution.
