Variables are used to temporarily store a value in the computer's memory. We can then use it later when we need it in the program. We can compare that to a small box in which we could store information.

Since Python is a dynamically typed language, Python values, not variables, carry type. This has implications for many aspects of the way the language functions.

All variables in Python hold references to objects, and these references are passed to functions; a function cannot change the value of variable references in its calling function (but see below for exceptions). Some people (including Guido van Rossum himself) have called this parameter-passing scheme "Call by object reference." An object reference means a name, and the passed reference is an "alias," i.e., a copy of the reference to the same object, just as in C/C++. The object's value may be changed in the called function with the "alias," for example:

## Naming and Code Writing Conventions

As in many programming languages, some conventions must be respected when naming a variable.

#### 1. The name of the variable must start with a letter or an underscore. The variable cannot start with a number or a hyphen.

❌ Bad example:
```python
# Do not do this
2Name = "James"

# Do not do this
-name = "James"
```

✅ Good example:
```python
# Do this
name = "James"

# Do this
_name = "James"
```

#### 2. Never put spaces between words.

❌ Bad example:
```python
# Do not do this
My name = "Odile"
```

✅ Good example:
```python
# Do this
my_name = "Odile"
```

#### 3. No accents on variable names. Use only English.

❌ Bad example:
```python
# Do not do this
prénom = "Odile"
```

✅ Good example:
```python
# Do this
first_name = "Odile"
```

#### 4. Always give an explicit name to the variable.

❌ Bad example:
```python
# Do not do this
a = "Odile"

# Do not do this
fstnme = "Odile"
```

✅ Good example:
```python
# Do this
first_name = "Odile"

# Do this
magic_potion = 42
```

## Examples:

#### Execution Control Keywords:
- `exec`: Used to execute dynamically created code or statements.

Example:
```python
code = "print('Hello, World!')"
exec(code)  # dynamically execute the code
```

#### Output Keywords:
- `print`: Used to output or display information to the console.

Example:
```python
print("Hello, World!")  # display "Hello, World!"
```

#### Variable Naming Examples:
```python
# BAD
2name = "James"

# BAD
-name = "Bond"

# BAD
My name = "bond"

# GOOD
name = "Bond"
print("Your name is", name)

last_name = "Bond"
first_name = "James"
text = "My name is {}, {} {}.".format(last_name, first_name, last_name)
print(text)

age = "34"
first_name = "Ludovic"
text = "Hello, my name is {} and I am {}".format(first_name, age)
print(text)

age = "34"
first_name = "Ludovic"
text = f"Hello, my name is {first_name} and I am {age}"
print(text)
```

## Data Types

Since Python is a high-level language, it has dynamic variable typing. By dynamic,

By dynamic typing, it means that the data type of a variable is determined dynamically at runtime based on the value assigned to it. Python supports several built-in data types, including:

1. Numeric Types:
   - `int`: Integer values, e.g., 5, -3, 0.
   - `float`: Floating-point values, e.g., 3.14, -2.5, 0.0.
   - `complex`: Complex numbers, e.g., 2+3j, -1-4j.

2. Sequence Types:
   - `str`: String of characters, e.g., "Hello", 'Python'.
   - `list`: Ordered, mutable collection of elements, e.g., [1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c'].
   - `tuple`: Ordered, immutable collection of elements, e.g., (1, 2, 3), ('a', 'b', 'c').

3. Mapping Type:
   - `dict`: Key-value pairs, e.g., {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}.

4. Set Types:
   - `set`: Unordered collection of unique elements, e.g., {1, 2, 3}, {'a', 'b', 'c'}.
   - `frozenset`: Immutable set, e.g., frozenset({1, 2, 3}).

5. Boolean Type:
   - `bool`: Represents either `True` or `False`.

6. None Type:
   - `None`: Represents the absence of a value.

You can determine the data type of a variable using the `type()` function. For example:

```python
x = 5
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>

y = "Hello, World!"
print(type(y))  # Output: <class 'str'>

z = [1, 2, 3]
print(type(z))  # Output: <class 'list'>
```

Python also allows you to convert between different data types using type conversion functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `list()`, `tuple()`, `dict()`, `set()`, etc. For example:

```python
x = 5
print(type(x))      # Output: <class 'int'>

y = float(x)
print(type(y))      # Output: <class 'float'>

z = str(x)
print(type(z))      # Output: <class 'str'>

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
set_of_numbers = set(numbers)
print(type(set_of_numbers))  # Output: <class 'set'>
```

Understanding and utilizing different data types is crucial in Python programming as it allows you to store and manipulate different kinds of values efficiently.
