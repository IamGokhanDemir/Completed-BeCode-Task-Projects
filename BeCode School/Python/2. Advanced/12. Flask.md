# Project: Form in Python with Flask ![image](https://github.com/IamGokhanDemir/Completed-BeCode-Task-Projects/assets/77242425/55c08fef-d8d4-4e33-841c-4132d6a53b47)


#### Duration: 5 days
- 1 day to learn about Flask: https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4425066-concevez-un-site-avec-flask
- 4 days to complete the project.

## Skills developed:
* Backend: PYTHON programming (introduction to logical structures)
* Sanitization and validation of a form
* Implementation of POST and GET methods
* Implementation of templates with Jinja

## Problem statement:
The company Hackers Poulette™ sells DIY kits and accessories for Rasperri Pi. They want to allow their users to contact their technical support. Your mission is to develop a Python script that displays a contact form and processes its response: sanitization, validation, and then sending feedback to the user.

## Performance criteria:
* If the user makes an error, the form should be returned to them with valid responses preserved in their respective input fields.
* Ideally, display error messages near their respective fields.
* The form will perform server-side sanitization and validation.
* If sanitization and validation are successful, a "Thank you for contacting us." page will be displayed, summarizing all the encoded information.
* Implementation of the honeypot anti-spam technique.

#### Form fields
First name & last name + email + country (list) + message + gender (M/F) (Radio box) + 3 possible subjects (Repair, Order, Others) (checkboxes). All fields are mandatory, except for the subject (in this case, the value should be "Others").

## Contact Form (Python)
* Presentation: server/client architecture (transmissive, 10")
* Sanitization: neutralizing any harmful encoding (<script>)
* Validation: mandatory fields + valid email
* Sending + Feedback
* NO NEED FOR JAVASCRIPT OR CSS

#### At the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain the difference between a POST request and a GET request.
- Protect yourself against XSS vulnerabilities.
- Protect yourself against SSTI attacks.
- Use a micro framework.
- Perform a deployment.


## What is Flask

## 🌐 Flask: A Micro Web Framework

Flask is a lightweight and user-friendly Python framework used for building web applications. It simplifies the process of handling web requests and rendering web pages.

## 🌐 Micro, but Powerful!

Flask is often referred to as a "micro" framework because it focuses on the fundamental components required for web development, such as URL routing and page rendering. However, it intentionally keeps certain functionalities, like form validation, database abstraction, and authentication, out of its core.

## 🌐 Enter Flask Extensions

To complement its simplicity, Flask offers a powerful concept called "Flask extensions." These extensions are specialized Python packages that provide additional features not included in Flask's core. They integrate seamlessly with Flask, giving the impression that they are part of the framework itself.

## 🌐 Seamless Integration

When you install Flask, certain default extensions come along with it. For instance, Flask doesn't have a built-in page template engine, but installing Flask automatically includes the Jinja templating engine, which is widely used for rendering dynamic web pages. Although technically not part of Flask, these extensions work harmoniously with the framework, making it easy to leverage their functionality.

## 🌐 Making It Convenient

Even though some features are not directly provided by Flask, the community generally considers the default extensions as part of Flask because of their tight integration and convenience in building web applications.

Flask's minimalist approach, combined with the versatility of its extensions, makes it a favorite among developers for creating web applications quickly and efficiently. 🚀

## Starting with Flask using VsCode (this is a standard setup the content/code will change based on the task given)


🐍 Setting up Flask Environment in VSCode 🚀

Before diving into building your Flask application, let's set up the environment in VSCode. Follow these steps:

1. 📦 Install Virtual Environment:
   Open the VSCode terminal and enter the command: `pip install virtualenv`
   This will install the virtual environment in VSCode (if not already installed).

2. 🌐 Create a Virtual Environment:
   Now, let's create a virtual environment. The standard name is `venv`.
   Enter the following command: `python3 -m venv venv`

3. 🚀 Activate the Virtual Environment:
   Activate the virtual environment with: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   (Note: If you encounter a "ps1 cannot be loaded" error, change the execution policy in PowerShell. Open PowerShell as administrator and run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`)

4. 📦 Install Flask:
   Now, install Flask with: `pip install flask`

5. 📁 Create the App File:
   Create a new Python file called `app.py`.

6. 🏁 Import Flask:
   Import Flask into the `app.py` file using: `from flask import Flask`
   Then, create a Flask application with a name, for example: `app = Flask(__name__)`

7. 🚩 Add Index Route:
   Use the `@app.route('/')` decorator to specify the index route.

8. 📝 Define the Index Function:
   Create a function under the decorator with: `def index():`
   Inside the function, return the string "Hello World!" as a response.

9. ▶️ Start the Application:
   Add the final code block:
   ```python
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

🎉 You're all set! Now you have a basic Flask environment in VSCode. Save the `app.py` file, and you can run the Flask application using `python app.py`. The server will start, and you'll see "Hello World!" when accessing the root route in your browser.


# Group Presentation - Core Concepts in Hackers Poulette™ 🚀

### Introduction:
In this group presentation, we will explore essential web security concepts using the fictional contact form application, Hackers Poulette™, built with Flask. We'll use code examples to explain the concepts in detail.

### 1) Difference between POST and GET Requests 📡

In the `app` code:
```python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Code for handling a POST request
        # ...
        return "Thank you for contacting us."

    # Code for handling a GET request
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    return render_template('index.html', now=now)
```

- **What is it?** POST and GET are HTTP methods used to transfer data between a client (e.g., browser) and a server. They are commonly used in web forms and APIs to send data.
- **How to?** 
  - 📥 GET: Used to retrieve data from the server. Data is sent in the URL as query parameters, visible in the browser's address bar.
  - 📤 POST: Used to send data to the server in the request body. Data is not visible in the URL. Typically used for sensitive information like passwords.

### 2) Sanitization - Keeping It Clean! 🧹

In the `index.html` template:
```html
<!-- Input field for first name -->
<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    <label for="fname">First Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" required style="width: 100%; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px;">
</div>
```

- **What is it?** Sanitization is the process of neutralizing or removing potentially harmful code, such as `<script>` tags or SQL injection attempts, from user input to prevent security vulnerabilities. The `required` attribute ensures that the first name input field must be filled before submitting the form.
- **How to?** 
  - 🛡️ Use libraries or frameworks that offer built-in input sanitization functions.
  - ✅ Implement server-side validation to check and clean user input for any malicious content.
  - 🚫 Avoid rendering user input directly into HTML templates without escaping or encoding.

### 3) Guarding Against XSS Vulnerabilities 🛡️

In the `index.html` template:
```html
{% if errors %}
<div style="color: red; text-align: center;">
    {% for error in errors %}
        <p>{{ error }}</p>
    {% endfor %}
</div>
{% endif %}
```
- **What is it?** XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a type of security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This allows the attacker to steal sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.
- **How to?**
  - 🛑 Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent script injection.
  - 🧭 Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources of executable content.
  - 📝 Escape output in HTML templates to prevent rendering of malicious scripts.
  - In the code above, Flask's built-in template engine automatically escapes the `errors` variable, preventing XSS attacks.

 

### 4) Shielding Against SSTI Attacks 🛡️

In the `index.html` template:
```html
<footer>
    &copy; {{ "now"|date("Y") }} Hackers Poulette™. All rights reserved.
    <br>
    <a href="#top" style="color: #fff;">Back to Top</a>
</footer>
```
- **What is it?** SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) is a security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious code into templates processed by the server, leading to unauthorized access or data leaks.
- **How to?**
  - 🚫 Avoid using user-provided input directly in templates. Instead, use a secure template engine with auto-escaping enabled.
  - 🔒 Limit access to the server's filesystem and other sensitive resources.
  - 🔄 Keep the software and dependencies up to date to avoid known vulnerabilities.
  - To prevent SSTI attacks, the code above safely uses the `now` variable to display the current year, ensuring no malicious input can interfere.


### The Honeypot Technique 🍯🕷️🚫

The honeypot technique is a simple and effective way to detect automated spam submissions in web forms. It involves adding an additional form field that is hidden from regular users but can be seen and filled out by bots and automated scripts.

In the provided code, the honeypot field is added to the form using the following HTML:

```html
<div style="display: none;">
    <label for="honeypot">Leave this field empty:</label>
    <input type="text" id="honeypot" name="honeypot">
</div>
```

This code creates a hidden `<div>` containing a label and an input field of type "text." Since the div is set to `display: none;`, it won't be visible on the webpage when users view the form.

However, bots and automated scripts typically don't interpret CSS, so they will still "see" and attempt to fill out this hidden field. When a bot fills out the honeypot field and submits the form, it reveals itself as a spam submission.

On the server side (implemented in Flask in this case), the Python code checks the value of the honeypot field when the form is submitted:

```python
# Get the honeypot field value
honeypot = request.form.get('honeypot', '')

# Check the honeypot field
if honeypot:
    # Honeypot field is not empty, treat it as spam
    return "Sorry, your submission was considered spam."
```

If the honeypot field has a value (meaning it was filled out), the server immediately rejects the submission, assuming it to be spam. Regular users won't fill out this field, so their submissions will proceed without any issues.

By using the honeypot technique, you can effectively block many automated spam submissions without adding intrusive CAPTCHAs or inconveniencing your regular users. It's not foolproof, but it can significantly reduce the amount of spam your form receives. 🛡️🚫💬

### How to Test the Honeypot Technique 🍯🕷️🧪

Testing the honeypot technique involves simulating the behavior of a sneaky bot or automated script attempting to fill out the hidden field. 🤖🔍💻

1. **Simulate Bot Behavior:** 🧪
   - Open your contact form in a web browser. 🌐📝
   - Open the browser's Developer Tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect"). 🛠️👀
   - Find the hidden honeypot field in the HTML code (it should be hidden from view). 🔍🤫
   - Manually add some text or value to the honeypot field using the Developer Tools to simulate bot behavior. 🕷️💬

2. **Submit the Form:** 🚀📝
   - Fill out the other fields in the form (first name, last name, email, etc.) with valid information. ✍️📋✔️
   - Click the "Submit" button to send the form. 🚀📤

3. **Observe the Result:** 👀📝
   - If the honeypot field is correctly implemented, the form submission should be rejected, and you should see a message like "Sorry, your submission was considered spam." 🚫❌🔴
   - This indicates that the honeypot technique detected the simulated bot behavior and prevented the form from being submitted. 🕷️❌🚫

4. **Test with a Regular Submission:** 🧪✔️
   - Repeat the test, but this time, do not add anything to the honeypot field. 🔄🚫🕷️
   - Fill out the other fields with valid information and click the "Submit" button. ✍️✔️🚀
   - The form should be successfully submitted, and you should see a "Thank you for contacting us" message or be redirected to a confirmation page. 🎉✅💬

Remember, testing the honeypot technique should be done with caution and only in your development environment. In a live production environment, real users won't interact with the honeypot field, as it will be hidden from view. The honeypot is designed to automatically catch and reject submissions from bots or automated scripts, so regular users won't be affected by it. 🧪✨🛡️

### Conclusion:
With examples from Hackers Poulette™, we covered crucial web security concepts like differentiating POST and GET requests, sanitization to prevent malicious input, guarding against XSS vulnerabilities, and shielding against SSTI attacks. By applying these practices, developers can build more secure and robust web applications. 🚀
