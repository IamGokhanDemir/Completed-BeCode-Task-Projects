**Exercise: PowerShell Navigation**

Now we will learn how to move around in the filesystem with `Set-Location`, `Get-Location`, `Get-ChildItem`, and more.

- Print your current location on the screen:

```powershell
Get-Location
```

- Print the content of your current directory:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem
```

- Print the content of your root (`C:` if you're running Windows, `/` for Linux):

```powershell
Get-ChildItem /
```

- Go into your home folder (`C:\Users\Username` for Windows, `/home/Username` for Linux):

```powershell
Set-Location ~
```

- Print the content of your home:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem ~
```

- Those commands are pretty long to type, do you know any shorter way to do it?

Yes, PowerShell provides aliases for some commonly used commands. Aliases are shorter versions or alternate names for commands. Here are some examples:

- To print the current location:

```powershell
pwd
```

- To print the content of the current directory:

```powershell
ls
```

- To go into your home folder:

```powershell
cd ~
```

- To print the content of your home folder:

```powershell
ls ~
```

By using these shorter aliases, you can navigate and interact with the filesystem more efficiently in PowerShell.
