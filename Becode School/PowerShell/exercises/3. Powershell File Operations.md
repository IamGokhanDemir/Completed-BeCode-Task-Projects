**Exercise: PowerShell File Operations**

Now that we know how to move in the file system, let's check how to manipulate files and folders. In this challenge, you will discover and use the commands `Get-Content`, `echo`, `New-Item`, `Move-Item`, `Copy-Item`, and `Remove-Item`.

- Create a file named `story1.txt`:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType File -Name story1.txt
```

Explanation: The `New-Item` command is used to create a new item (file or folder) in the file system. In this case, we specify the `-ItemType` parameter as `File` to create a file, and `-Name` parameter to set the name of the file.

- Type `echo "Hello World" > story1.txt`:

```powershell
echo "Hello World" > story1.txt
```

Explanation: The `echo` command is used to display text on the console. In this case, we are using it in conjunction with the `>` symbol to redirect the output of the echo command to the `story1.txt` file, effectively creating the file and writing "Hello World" to it.

- Print the content of the file:

```powershell
Get-Content story1.txt
```

Explanation: The `Get-Content` command is used to retrieve the content of a file. By specifying the file name (`story1.txt` in this case), it will display the content of the file on the console.

- Create a folder named `story`:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Name story
```

Explanation: Similar to creating a file, the `New-Item` command can also create a directory (folder) by specifying the `-ItemType` parameter as `Directory`. The `-Name` parameter is used to set the name of the folder, which in this case is `story`.

- Move `story1.txt` inside `story`:

```powershell
Move-Item story1.txt story
```

Explanation: The `Move-Item` command is used to move a file or folder from one location to another. In this case, we are moving `story1.txt` to the `story` folder by specifying the source and destination paths.

- Copy `story1.txt` as `story2.txt`:

```powershell
Copy-Item story\story1.txt story\story2.txt
```

Explanation: The `Copy-Item` command is used to create a copy of a file or folder. Here, we are creating a copy of `story1.txt` named `story2.txt` within the `story` folder.

- Print both files:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem story
```

Explanation: The `Get-ChildItem` command is used to retrieve the child items (files and folders) within a specified location. By specifying the `story` folder, it will display both files (`story1.txt` and `story2.txt`) within that folder.

- Rename `story2.txt` as `me.txt`:

```powershell
Rename-Item story\story2.txt me.txt
```

Explanation: The `Rename-Item` command is used to change the name of a file or folder. Here, we are renaming `story2.txt` to `me.txt` within the `story` folder.

- Append `me.txt` and add "I am a junior at Becode":

```powershell
Add-Content me.txt "I am a junior at Becode"
```

Explanation: The `Add-Content` command is used to add content to a file. By specifying the file (`me.txt`) and the content to be added ("

I am a junior at Becode" in this case), it will append the specified content to the file.

- Remove the folder `story` with its content:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse story
```

Explanation: The `Remove-Item` command is used to delete files and folders. By specifying the `-Recurse` parameter, it ensures that the `story` folder and its contents are removed recursively (including all files and subfolders within it).

By using these PowerShell commands, you can create, manipulate, and remove files and folders as needed. Make sure to double-check your paths and file names to ensure accurate execution.
