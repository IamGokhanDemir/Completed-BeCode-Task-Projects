**Exercise: PowerShell Environment Variables**

Environment variables are a way to store and access data at the OS level, allowing information to be shared between different applications. In this exercise, we will explore how to work with environment variables in PowerShell.

**Instructions:**

1. Open a PowerShell terminal.
2. Type the following command to display your computer name:

```powershell
echo $env:computername
```

Explanation: The `$env:computername` environment variable holds the name of your computer. Using the `echo` command, we can retrieve and display its value.

3. Create a variable named `test` and assign it a value:

```powershell
$env:test = "hello powershell"
```

Explanation: Here, we create an environment variable named `test` and assign it the value `"hello powershell"`.

4. Check the value of the `test` variable:

```powershell
echo $env:test
```

Explanation: Using the `echo` command, we can retrieve and display the value of the `test` environment variable.

5. Append a string to the `test` variable:

```powershell
$env:test += " Becode"
```

Explanation: This command appends the string `" Becode"` to the existing value of the `test` environment variable.

6. Check the updated value of the `test` variable:

```powershell
echo $env:test
```

Explanation: We can use `echo` to verify that the value of the `test` environment variable has been updated.

7. Modify the `$env:path` environment variable:

```powershell
$env:path += ";C:\Users\Username\Desktop"
```

Explanation: This command adds the path to the desktop directory (where the Rufus executable is located) to the `$env:path` environment variable. By including this path, we can run Rufus from any location in the command line.

8. Call Rufus from anywhere in the command line:

```powershell
rufus-3.13p.exe
```

Explanation: After adding the Rufus executable's path to the `$env:path` environment variable, we can simply type the executable name (`rufus-3.13p.exe`) to launch Rufus from any location in the command line.

9. Explore recognized environment variables on Windows:

Refer to [the recognized environment variables available on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/usmt/usmt-recognized-environment-variables) to understand various environment variables that are recognized and can be used in Windows.

10. Write a small script reporting computer specifications and convert it to a CSV file:

```powershell
$computerSpecs = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ComputerSystem
$computerSpecs | Export-Csv -Path "computer_specs.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

Explanation: This script retrieves computer specifications using the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet, specifically targeting the `Win32_ComputerSystem` class. The retrieved data is then exported to a CSV file named `computer_specs.csv` using `Export-Csv`.

**Securely executing a saved script:**

When you save a PowerShell script, by default, it may be blocked from executing due to the execution policy set on your system. To change this and enable script execution in a secure way, follow these steps:

1. Open a PowerShell terminal as an administrator.
2. Set the execution policy to a desired level. For example, to set it to `RemoteSigned`:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Explanation: The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` command allows you to change the execution policy for PowerShell scripts. The `RemoteSigned` policy allows the execution of locally created scripts

 while requiring a digital signature for remote scripts.

3. Confirm the execution policy change by typing `Y` or `A`.

Now, you should be able to execute your saved PowerShell script without any issues.

> **WARNING**: This exercise will only work on Windows systems since it's specific to the way Windows manages environment variables. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify environment variables and execute scripts on your system.
