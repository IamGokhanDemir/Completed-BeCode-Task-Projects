## Authentication and Authorization

**Authentication:**
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a person or entity. It ensures that the claimed identity is valid and trustworthy. It's like showing your ID to prove who you are. For example, when you enter a username and password to access your email account, the system checks if the information matches what's on record.

**Authorization:**
Authorization comes after authentication. Once your identity is confirmed, authorization determines what you're allowed to do or access. It's like getting a pass to enter a restricted area after proving your identity. For instance, after logging into a social media account, authorization defines whether you can post, comment, or view specific content.

In a nutshell:
- **Authentication:** Proving who you are.
- **Authorization:** Deciding what you're allowed to do.

Remember the hotel analogy:
- **Authentication:** Showing your ID at the reception.
- **Authorization:** Using the keycard to access your specific room.

Authentication and authorization work together to ensure secure access to systems, data, and resources.
