## **🦠 Demystifying Malware**

Let's unravel the mysteries of malware, including viruses, worms, trojans, and their actions. By understanding these basics, you can better protect yourself from cyber threats.

### **🌐 What is Malware?**

- **Malware** = Malicious + Software.
- It's software designed by cybercriminals to harm systems, steal data, or disrupt operations.
- Consists of two core components:
   - **Propagation Mechanism**: How malware spreads.
   - **Payload**: What actions malware performs.

### **🔍 Propagation Mechanism**

- **Virus**: Requires user action to spread (e.g., downloading an infected file).
- **Worm**: Self-propagates without user intervention, exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Trojan**: Deceives users by pretending to be legitimate software.

### **🦠 Types of Malware**

- **Virus**: Needs user interaction to spread; contaminates when user performs a specific action.
- **Worm**: Self-replicates, exploiting system vulnerabilities, and spreading across networks.
- **Trojan**: Disguises as legitimate software while secretly performing malicious actions.

### **📦 What is Payload?**

- **Payload**: Malware's action on an infected system.
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts files, demands ransom for decryption.
- **Spyware**: Monitors devices, collects sensitive information.
- **Backdoors**: Exploits vulnerabilities, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Botnet**: Joins device to a network, controlled remotely for malicious activities.

**📌 Remember:** Understanding malware types and their payloads is crucial for staying protected against cyber threats.
