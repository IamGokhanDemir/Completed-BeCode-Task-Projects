- Perfect for single-resource workloads

### User-Assigned Managed Identity:

- Created as a standalone Azure resource
- Independent lifecycle‚Äîexplicitly delete when needed
- Shareable across multiple Azure resources
- Ideal for versatile workloads and shared identities

## Devices: Unveiling Hardware Identities üì±üíª

### Azure AD Registered Devices:

- BYOD or mobile device support
