## **üåü Mastering Data Insights with Microsoft Purview Data Classification**

In today's data-driven world, understanding, safeguarding, and governing your data are key challenges. Microsoft Purview's **Data Classification Capabilities** offer powerful tools to conquer these tasks effectively. Let's explore these tools and their benefits, all presented in an easy-to-remember format!

### **1. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Sensitive Information Types (SIT)**

**Sensitive Information Types (SIT)** are like detectives that identify sensitive data patterns. They come with predefined patterns, such as credit card numbers or health service IDs, using regular expressions. You can also create custom SITs for your unique needs, and Exact Data Match (EDM) classification is supported for pinpoint accuracy.

### **2. üß† Trainable Classifiers**

**Trainable Classifiers** use AI and machine learning to understand your data's content, not just patterns. They're perfect for classifying organization-specific data like contracts or customer records. There are two types:

- **Pre-trained Classifiers:** Ready-to-use for categories like resumes or source code.
- **Custom Trainable Classifiers:** Tailored for your organization's unique content, created by training with relevant samples.

### **3. üßê Content and Activity Explorers**

- **Content Explorer:** Think of it as your data's tour guide. It offers insights into classified content, allowing you to review stored content from various platforms.

- **Activity Explorer:** This is your data's activity tracker. It shows actions like label changes and file movements, helping you assess control effectiveness.

### **4. üí° Harnessing Data Classification**

By embracing data classification, you enjoy:

- **Insights:** Understand your data landscape across diverse environments.
- **Protection:** Implement flexible safeguards like encryption and access restrictions.
- **Governance:** Automate data management for compliance and retention.

This toolkit ensures data integrity, regulatory compliance, and proactive risk management at every step.
