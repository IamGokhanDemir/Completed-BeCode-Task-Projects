## Configure Risk Event Detections 🚧

To safeguard your users effectively, Microsoft Entra ID Protection provides the means to configure risk-based policies that automatically respond to potential security threats. These policies work in tandem with existing Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies, adding an extra layer of protection to your organization. Even if your users never trigger a risky behavior, having these policies in place ensures your organization is fortified against potential security compromises.

🚦 Each day, Microsoft collects and analyzes trillions of anonymized signals generated during user sign-in attempts. These signals help establish patterns of normal user sign-in behavior and pinpoint any suspicious sign-in attempts. Microsoft Entra ID Protection is designed to review these sign-in attempts and initiate additional actions in response to any unusual or suspicious activities. Here are some potential triggers for Microsoft Entra ID Protection risk detection:

1. 🔑 **Users with compromised credentials** (leaked credentials).
2. 🌐 **Sign-ins from anonymous IP addresses**.
3. 🌍 **Sign-ins from locations considered atypical or impossible** based on previous behavior.
4. 🛡️ **Sign-ins from devices that show signs of infection**.
5. 📡 **Sign-ins from IP addresses exhibiting suspicious activity**.

Microsoft Entra ID Protection offers three policies designed to protect users and address suspicious activities. These policies can be customized based on your organization's needs:

1. 🚧 **User Risk Policy**: This policy identifies and responds to user accounts that may have compromised credentials. It can prompt the user to reset their password for added security.

2. ⚠️ **Sign-In Risk Policy**: The sign-in risk policy is tailored to identify and respond to suspicious sign-in attempts. If such an attempt is detected, it can prompt the user to provide additional verification, typically in the form of Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA).

3. 📲 **MFA Registration Policy**: This policy ensures that users are registered for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication. It plays a pivotal role when a sign-in risk policy triggers an MFA request; the user must already be registered for Microsoft Entra MFA.

🎯 When you enable a user or sign-in risk policy, you can choose from different risk thresholds, which include:

- 🟢 Low and above
- 🟡 Medium and above
- 🔴 High

This flexibility empowers your organization to fine-tune its security controls based on the perceived level of risk, enabling you to be as aggressive as necessary in enforcing measures for suspicious sign-in events.

Microsoft Entra ID Protection provides you with a valuable security toolkit to protect your users against potential threats, and with the ability to customize policies, you can tailor these protections to the specific needs and risk tolerance of your organization.
