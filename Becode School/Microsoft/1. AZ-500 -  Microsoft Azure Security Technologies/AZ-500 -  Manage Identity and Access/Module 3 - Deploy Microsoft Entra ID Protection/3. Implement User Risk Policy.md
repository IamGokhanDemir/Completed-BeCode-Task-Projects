## Implement User Risk Policy üöÄ

Microsoft Entra ID Protection is capable of assessing normal user behavior and determining their risk level based on this behavior. User risk is essentially a probability calculation that helps identify whether an identity has been compromised. Administrators have the power to make decisions based on these risk scores to enforce organizational security requirements.

üìä The User Risk Policy is a critical component in responding to users with varying risk levels. It allows you to:

1. **Automatically Respond Based on User Risk Levels**: Define conditions (risk levels) and specify actions (e.g., block or allow).

2. üìà **Set Thresholds for Risk Levels**:
   - Use a high threshold for policy rollouts, providing a balance between security and user experience.
   - Opt for a low threshold to prioritize greater security, potentially impacting user convenience.

üîç **Understanding Risky Users**:

The insights you gain from the Risky Users report are invaluable. With this information, administrators can:

- Identify which users are at risk, those who have had their risk mitigated, or whose risk has been dismissed.
- Access detailed information about detections, including the history of all risky sign-ins.

‚öôÔ∏è **Risk History and Action**:

Administrators can take various actions based on the events and user risk levels, such as:

- **Reset User Password**: In cases where compromise is suspected or to ensure the security of the account.
- **Confirm User Compromise**: To verify suspicions and initiate appropriate security measures.
- **Dismiss User Risk**: When a false positive or low-risk event is detected.
- **Block User from Signing In**: As a precautionary step if a user's account is at significant risk.
- **Further Investigation Using Azure ATP**: To delve deeper into security incidents when required.

User Risk Policies provide the flexibility to respond to the ever-changing landscape of user risk, ensuring that your organization's security remains adaptive and resilient.
