# Explore Microsoft Entra ID Protection üõ°Ô∏è

Microsoft Entra ID Protection is a robust tool designed to help organizations address identity-related security risks effectively. Let's break down what you can accomplish with this powerful resource:

1. **Automate Risk Detection and Remediation**: Entra ID Protection automates the detection and resolution of identity-based security risks. It keeps an eagle eye on user accounts and identifies any suspicious activities, enabling timely remediation.

2. **Investigate Risks with Portal Data**: It offers a user-friendly portal that allows you to investigate and dive deep into identified risks. You can analyze and understand the nature of these risks using the data provided in the portal.

3. **Export Data for Further Analysis**: Entra ID Protection lets you export risk detection data to third-party utilities for more in-depth analysis. This is incredibly valuable for organizations looking to combine data from multiple sources.

Microsoft's vast experience in safeguarding identities across various domains, including Microsoft Entra ID, consumer accounts, and even gaming with Xbox, has informed the development of Entra ID Protection. To give you an idea of the scale of their efforts, Microsoft analyzes a mind-boggling 6.5 trillion signals per day to spot and protect against potential threats.

Key features and aspects of Microsoft Entra ID Protection include:

**Risk Detections**: It identifies any suspicious actions associated with user accounts in your directory. The signals generated can be integrated into tools like Conditional Access to make access decisions. Alternatively, they can be fed into security information and event management (SIEM) tools for more detailed investigation based on your organization's policies.

**Identity Protection Policies**: Entra ID Protection offers three default policies that administrators can opt to enable. While these policies provide limited customization, they are suitable for most organizations. These policies also allow for the exclusion of specific users, such as emergency access or break-glass administrator accounts.

**1. Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Registration Policy**: This policy is excellent for encouraging the adoption of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). It leverages a Conditional Access policy that requires MFA registration at sign-in. This ensures that new users in your organization register for MFA on their first day, bolstering security. MFA also serves as a self-remediation method for risk events, empowering users to take action and reduce helpdesk calls.

**2. Sign-In Risk Policy**: Entra ID Protection continuously analyzes signals from each sign-in, both in real-time and offline. It calculates a risk score based on the likelihood that the sign-in was not performed by the legitimate user. Administrators can then decide how to respond based on this risk score. They can choose to block access, allow access, or permit access but require multi-factor authentication. When a risk is detected, users can perform multi-factor authentication to self-remediate, closing the risky sign-in event and reducing the workload on administrators.

**3. Custom Conditional Access Policy**: Administrators have the flexibility to create custom Conditional Access policies, including sign-in risk as an assignment condition. This level of customization allows organizations to tailor their security measures to specific needs.

Microsoft Entra ID Protection is a comprehensive tool that equips organizations to protect their identities effectively, streamline security responses, and mitigate potential risks.
