# Azure AD DS vs. Self-Managed AD DS

🔵 When it comes to providing Active Directory Domain Services in the cloud, you have two options:

## 1. Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) 🌐

- **Managed Service**: Microsoft handles resource deployment and maintenance.
- **Simplified**: Reduced complexity with no need to manage VMs, OS, or domain controllers.
- **Key Features**: NTLM/Kerberos authentication, DNS server, custom OU structure, Group Policy.

## 2. Self-Managed Active Directory Domain Services (Self-Managed AD DS) 🏢

- **Administrator Responsibility**: You create, configure, and maintain resources like VMs, OS, and AD DS.
- **Versatility**: Allows for tasks like schema extensions and forest trusts.
- **Deployment Models**: Standalone cloud-only AD DS, Resource forest, Extend on-premises domain to Azure.

💼 **Choosing Between Them**

Here's a comparison of features between Azure AD DS and Self-Managed AD DS:
