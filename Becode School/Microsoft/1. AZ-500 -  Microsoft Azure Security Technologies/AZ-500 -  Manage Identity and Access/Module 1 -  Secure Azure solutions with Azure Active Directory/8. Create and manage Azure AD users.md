# Managing Azure AD Users Made Easy 🧑‍💼

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) makes user management a breeze. Whether you're onboarding new team members or collaborating with external partners, these steps will guide you:

## Add a New User 👥

🚀 **Sign in** to the Azure portal as a User Administrator or Global Administrator.

👉 Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Users**.

➕ Choose **Create new user** or **Invite external user** from the menu.

[user]

📝 On the **New User** page:

   - 🆔 **Identity**: Add username, display name, first, and last name.
   - 🎯 **Groups and roles**: Assign to groups if needed.
   - ⚙️ **Settings**: Toggle sign-in block or set default location.
   - 🌐 **Job info**: Include job title, department, company, and manager.

🔑 Copy the auto-generated password from the **Password** box and share it with the user.

✅ Click **Create**.

Your user is now part of your Azure AD organization.

## Add a New Guest User 👤

Need to collaborate with external partners? Here's how:

1. On the **New User** page, choose **Invite user**.

2. Configure your organization's external collaboration settings.

3. The invited user will receive an email invitation that they must accept to start collaborating.

## Add Other Users 👩‍💻

For special scenarios:

- If you have Azure AD B2C, manually create consumer accounts.

- If you're working with Windows Server Active Directory, sync user accounts.

## Deleting a User 🗑️

To remove a user:

1. Sign in as a Global Administrator, Privileged Authentication Administrator, or User Administrator.

2. Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Users**.

3. Find and select the user to delete.

4. Click **Delete user**.

5. The user is deleted and can be found in Deleted users for 30 days.

Remember, when you delete a user, their licenses become available for others.

Note: For updates on users from Windows Server Active Directory, use that system and wait for the next sync cycle.
