## Simplify Access Management with Azure AD Groups üîê

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) offers efficient ways to control access to resources, apps, and tasks. Using Azure AD groups, you can streamline access management by granting permissions to groups of users rather than individual users. This approach aligns with the Zero Trust security principle of limiting access to only those who need it.

### What Can You Manage with Azure AD Groups? ü§ù

Azure AD groups allow you to manage access to:

1. Resources within your Azure AD organization, granting permissions through Azure AD roles.
2. External resources, including Software as a Service (SaaS) apps.
3. Azure services.
4. SharePoint sites.
5. On-premises resources.

### Group Management Guidelines üìú

Before creating a group, it's essential to understand the group types and membership options:

#### Group Types:
- **Security Groups**: Used for managing access to shared resources. You can assign users, devices, other groups, and service principals as members. Owners can be users or service principals.

- **Microsoft 365 Groups**: Promote collaboration by providing access to shared mailboxes, calendars, files, SharePoint sites, and more. Members are limited to users, and owners can be users or service principals. External parties can also access these groups.

#### Membership Types:
- **Assigned Membership**: Allows you to manually add specific users as members with unique permissions.

- **Dynamic User Membership**: Automatically adds and removes members based on dynamic rules. When a member's attributes change, the system assesses the rules to determine their status.

- **Dynamic Device Membership**: Automatically includes or excludes devices based on dynamic rules. Similar to dynamic user membership, this depends on device attributes.

üìù **Note**: Dynamic groups can be created for either devices or users, not both. Device group rules must reference device attributes.

Azure AD groups simplify access management for a more secure and efficient organization. üöÄ
