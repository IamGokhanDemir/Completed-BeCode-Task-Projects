# Explore Azure Active Directory Features

üîç **Azure Active Directory Overview**
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service. This service empowers employees to access various resources, including Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and numerous other software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. Azure Active Directory also facilitates access to internal resources such as corporate intranet apps and cloud apps tailored for your organization.

## Who Uses Azure AD?

üë§ **IT Admins**
As an IT administrator, you can utilize Azure AD to control access to apps and app resources, aligning with your business requirements. For example, enforce multi-factor authentication for crucial organizational resources and automate user provisioning between Windows Server AD and cloud apps, including Microsoft 365. Azure AD equips you with robust tools for safeguarding user identities and credentials and complying with access governance needs.

üë©‚Äçüíª **App Developers**
App developers can employ Azure AD as a standards-based approach to integrate single sign-on (SSO) into their apps, allowing seamless user authentication with pre-existing credentials. Azure AD also offers APIs for creating personalized app experiences using organizational data.

üìä **Microsoft 365, Office 365, Azure, or Dynamics CRM Online Subscribers**
Subscribers to Microsoft 365, Office 365, Azure, or Dynamics CRM Online are already using Azure AD. Each tenant of these services automatically becomes an Azure AD tenant, enabling immediate management of integrated cloud apps.
