In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), if another administrator or nonadministrator needs to manage Azure AD resources, you assign them an Azure AD role that provides the permissions they need. For example, you can assign roles to allow adding or changing users, resetting user passwords, managing user licenses, or managing domain names.

With this role, users can add new identity providers and configure all available settings (for example, authentication path, service ID, assigned key containers). This user can enable the Azure AD organization to trust authentications from external identity providers. The resulting impact on end-user experiences depends on the type of organization:  <br>  <br>-Azure AD organizations for employees and partners: The addition of a federation (for example, with Gmail) immediately impacts all guest invitations not yet redeemed. See Adding Google as an identity provider for B2B guest users.  <br>  <br>-Azure Active Directory B2C organizations: The addition of a federation (for example, with Facebook, or with another Azure AD organization) doesn't immediately impact end-user flows until the identity provider is added as an option in a user flow (also called a built-in policy).|

|Global Reader|Users in this role can read settings and administrative information across Microsoft 365 services but can't take management actions. Global Reader is the read-only counterpart to Global Administrator. Assign Global Reader instead of Global Administrator for planning, audits, or investigations.
