# Deploy Federation with Microsoft Entra ID üåêüîí

Federation is the establishment of trust among various domains. It encompasses trust in terms of authentication and often extends to authorization. A typical federation scenario involves multiple organizations that have forged trust relationships to facilitate shared access to a common pool of resources.

In your quest for a robust authentication and authorization system, you can federate your on-premises environment with Microsoft Entra ID. This federation serves as the backbone for user authentication and authorization, with a special emphasis on ensuring that all authentication activities happen on-premises. This approach empowers administrators to enforce stringent access control policies.

üì¢ **Important**: If you opt for Federation with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), it's wise to set up password hash synchronization as a contingency plan. This serves as a failover mechanism in case your AD FS infrastructure encounters any issues.
