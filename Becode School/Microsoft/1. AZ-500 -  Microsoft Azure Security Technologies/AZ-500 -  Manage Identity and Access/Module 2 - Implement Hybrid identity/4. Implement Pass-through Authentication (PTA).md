# Implement Pass-through Authentication (PTA) üîëüåê

Azure AD Pass-through Authentication (PTA) is your key to achieving seamless cloud authentication while keeping your on-premises Active Directory in the loop. PTA offers the same advantages as Azure AD Password Hash Synchronization, allowing users to access both on-premises and cloud-based applications using their familiar user accounts and passwords.

## Benefits of PTA üöÄ

Here's why you should consider implementing PTA:

1. **Browser and Office App Support**: PTA supports user sign-in to web browser-based apps and modern authentication-enabled Microsoft Office client applications.

2. **Flexible Sign-in Usernames**: You can use either the on-premises default username (userPrincipalName) or another attribute configured in Azure AD Connect (Alternate ID) for sign-in.

3. **Enhanced Security**: PTA seamlessly integrates with Azure Active Directory Multi-Factor Authentication and other conditional access features, bolstering user security.

4. **Self-Service Password Management**: Enjoy cloud-based self-service password management, including password writeback to on-premises Active Directory and protection against commonly used passwords.

5. **Multi-Forest Support**: PTA has your back in multi-forest environments, provided there are forest trusts and correct name suffix routing configurations.

6. **Cost-Effective**: PTA is a free feature, and you don't need any paid Azure AD editions to use it.

## How PTA Works üîÑ

PTA operates smoothly with the following key features:

- **Lightweight On-Premises Agent**: A lightweight on-premises agent listens for and responds to password validation requests, ensuring secure user sign-in.

- **High Availability**: Installing multiple agents ensures high availability for sign-in requests.

- **Protection Against Attacks**: PTA safeguards your on-premises accounts from brute force password attacks in the cloud.

üì¢ **Important**: You can configure PTA without using a federation service, making it accessible to organizations of all sizes. PTA isn't just for user sign-in; it enables you to leverage other Azure AD features like password management, role-based access control, published applications, and conditional access policies.
