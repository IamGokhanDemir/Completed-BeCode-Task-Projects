# Configure Password Writeback üîê

Companies often operate with traditional on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) alongside cloud-based services. Keeping these two worlds in sync, especially when it comes to password changes, is crucial. Microsoft offers a solution called "Password Writeback" enabled through Microsoft Entra Connect. This feature ensures that password changes made in the cloud are instantly reflected in your existing on-premises directory.

Here's what Password Writeback provides:

**1. Enforcement of On-Premises AD DS Password Policies**: When a user resets their password in the cloud, Password Writeback checks if it complies with your on-premises AD DS policy. This comprehensive review includes checks for password history, complexity, age, password filters, and any other restrictions defined in your local AD DS.

**2. Zero-Delay Feedback**: Password Writeback operates synchronously, meaning it provides instant feedback to your users. If their password doesn't meet the policy or if there are any issues with the reset, they are notified immediately.

**3. Supports Password Changes from Various Sources**: Whether users are accessing the password reset feature via the access panel or through Microsoft 365, Password Writeback ensures that these changes are written back to your local AD DS environment. This applies to federated or password hash synchronized users.

**4. Admin-Initiated Password Resets**: When an admin resets a user's password from the Azure portal, Password Writeback ensures that the change is written back to your on-premises AD DS. Note that this functionality is not supported in the Office admin portal.

**5. No Inbound Firewall Rules Required**: Password Writeback is designed to work seamlessly without requiring inbound firewall rules. It leverages an Azure Service Bus relay for communication, ensuring that all interactions are outbound over port 443.

üì¢ **Important**: To utilize self-service password reset (SSPR) with Password Writeback, you must have already configured Microsoft Entra Connect in your environment.
