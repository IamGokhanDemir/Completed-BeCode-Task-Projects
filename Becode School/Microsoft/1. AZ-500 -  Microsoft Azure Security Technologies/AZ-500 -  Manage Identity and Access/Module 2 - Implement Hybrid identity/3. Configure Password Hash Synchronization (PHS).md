# Configuring Password Hash Synchronization (PHS) üîÑüîê

Ever experienced the frustration of forgetting passwords and the resulting helpdesk calls for password resets? Password Hash Synchronization (PHS) comes to the rescue! It's a nifty feature that synchronizes user passwords from your on-premises Active Directory to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). With PHS, you can sign in seamlessly to various Azure AD services like Microsoft 365, Microsoft Intune, CRM Online, and Azure AD Domain Services (Azure AD DS) using the same password you use for your on-premises Active Directory.

## Benefits of Password Hash Synchronization üöÄ

PHS offers several advantages:

1. **Improved User Productivity**: Users don't have to remember multiple passwords, enhancing their efficiency.

2. **Reduced Helpdesk Costs**: Say goodbye to the flood of password-related helpdesk calls; PHS cuts down on these support requests.

## How Does It Work? ü§ñ

Here's the magic behind PHS:

1. **Password Synchronization**: PHS takes the user's password hash from your on-premises Active Directory, encrypts it, and sends it to Azure as a string.

2. **Azure Storage**: Azure decrypts the received encrypted hash and stores it as a user attribute in Azure AD.

3. **User Sign-In**: When a user signs in to an Azure service, the sign-in challenge generates a hash of the user's password and sends it to Azure.

4. **Hash Comparison**: Azure compares the received hash with the stored hash in the user's account. If they match, access is granted.

5. **Remembered Credentials**: Users can save their credentials, avoiding repeated prompts for future Azure resource access.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: It's essential to note that PHS offers the same sign-in, not single sign-on. While the user's username and password are the same, they still authenticate against two separate directory services. It's a simpler alternative to implementing Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).

Configure PHS and enjoy the benefits of streamlined password management and enhanced user productivity!
