# Configure Password Hash Synchronization (PHS) ðŸ”’

Have you ever been blocked from work because you forgot a password? The more passwords you have to remember, the higher the chances of forgetting one. Password-related issues, like resets and forgotten passwords, can be a major drain on helpdesk resources. But fear not! Password Hash Synchronization (PHS) is here to simplify your life.

## What is PHS? ðŸ”„

Password Hash Synchronization (PHS) is a nifty feature that synchronizes user passwords from your on-premises Active Directory to Azure AD in the cloud. This means you can use the same password for Azure AD services like Microsoft 365, Microsoft Intune, CRM Online, and Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) as you do for your on-premises Active Directory.

### Benefits of PHS ðŸŒŸ

Here's why you should consider using PHS:

1. **Boost User Productivity**: Users can seamlessly sign in to Azure AD services, making their lives easier.

2. **Cut Helpdesk Costs**: Say goodbye to the hassle of password-related calls and resets, saving time and resources.

## How Does PHS Work? ðŸ¤–

Behind the scenes, PHS works its magic:

1. **Password Hash Extraction**: PHS grabs your user's password hash from your on-premises Active Directory.

2. **Encryption**: It encrypts this hash and sends it to Azure.

3. **Storage**: Azure stores this encrypted password hash as a user attribute in Azure AD.

Now, when a user signs in to an Azure service, here's what happens:

1. **Password Hash Generation**: The sign-in challenge dialog box creates a hash of the user's password.

2. **Comparison**: Azure compares this hash with the stored one in the user's account.

3. **Access Granted**: If the hashes match, the passwords match too, and the user gets access to the resource. Plus, there's an option to save credentials, so future sign-ins are a breeze.

### Important Note ðŸš¨

Remember, PHS is about the same sign-in, not single sign-on. Users authenticate against two separate directory services, but with the same username and password. It's a simple alternative to a more complex AD FS (Active Directory Federation Services) implementation.

With PHS, you can streamline authentication, enhance productivity, and reduce the burden on your helpdesk. It's a win-win!

Now, are you ready to test your knowledge?
