Hybrid Identity is the process of connecting your on-premises Active Directory with your Azure Active Directory. You do this to enable a single account to have access to resources on-premises and in the cloud. There are many other security benefits as well.

- Connect your on-premises AD with your Azure AD.
- Select the best authentication option based on your user's needs and your security goals.
- Configure authentication options to create your most secure environment.
