**HTML** stands for *HyperText Markup Language* and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage. It uses a set of tags to structure the content and define the layout of a webpage. Let's go through the HTML code you've learned in detail with examples:

1. Opening and Closing Tags:
   Most HTML elements consist of opening and closing tags. The opening tag starts with a less than symbol (`<`), followed by the tag name, and ends with a greater than symbol (`>`). The closing tag is similar, but it includes a forward slash (`/`) before the tag name. The content of the element is placed between the opening and closing tags. For example:

   ```html
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
   ```

2. Nesting Elements:
   HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child, and the outer element is the parent. This allows you to create a hierarchical structure for your webpage. For example:

   ```html
   <div>
     <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
     <p>This is the content of the website.</p>
   </div>
   ```

3. The `<body>` Tag:
   Any visible content of a webpage should be placed within the opening `<body>` tag and closing `</body>` tag. This is where you put your main content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and other elements.

4. Headings:
   Headings are used to provide titles for sections of content. HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. `<h1>` is the highest level, typically used for the main heading of a page, while `<h6>` is the lowest level. For example:

   ```html
   <h1>Main Heading</h1>
   <h2>Sub Heading</h2>

   ```

5. Text Elements:
   HTML provides various text elements for different purposes. The `<p>` element represents a paragraph of text. The `<span>` element is an inline container used to apply styles or manipulate parts of the text. The `<div>` element is a block-level container used to group elements together. For example:

   ```html
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
   <span style="color: red;">This is a red text.</span>
   <div>This is a block-level container.</div>
   ```

6. Emphasizing Text:
   HTML provides the `<em>` and `<strong>` tags to emphasize text. The `<em>` tag typically renders as italicized text, while the `<strong>` tag renders as bold text. For example:

   ```html
   <p><em>This</em> is emphasized text.</p>
   <p><strong>This</strong> is strong text.</p>
   ```

7. Line Breaks:
   Line breaks can be created using the `<br>` tag. It inserts a single line break within a block of text. For example:

   ```html
   <p>This is the first line.<br>This is the second line.</p>
   ```

8. Lists:
   HTML supports two types of lists: ordered lists (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`). Ordered lists are numbered, while unordered lists are bulleted. List items are marked with the `<li>` tag. For example:

   ```html
   <ol>
     <li>Item 1</li>
     <li>Item 2</li>
     <li>Item 3</li>
   </ol>

   <ul>
     <li>Item A</li>
     <li>

Item B</li>
     <li>Item C</li>
   </ul>
   ```

9. Images and Videos:
   Images can be added to a webpage using the `<img>` tag. It requires a `src` attribute that specifies the path to the image file. Videos can be included using the `<video>` tag, which also requires a `src` attribute. For example:

   ```html
   <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">

   <video src="video.mp4" controls></video>
   ```

   In the first example, `image.jpg` is the path to the image file, and "Description of the image" is the alternative text. In the second example, `video.mp4` is the path to the video file, and the `controls` attribute adds video controls to the player.

These are the HTML code elements you've learned with explanations and examples. Remember that HTML is a versatile language, and there are many more elements and attributes available for creating rich and interactive web pages.
