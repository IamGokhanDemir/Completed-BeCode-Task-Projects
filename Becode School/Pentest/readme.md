## Introduction üåü

Welcome to the world of cybersecurity! Here, we'll unravel the role of a pentester‚Äîa digital detective who ensures networks are safe and sound. :detective:

## Role of a Pentester üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In a world where cyber threats are rampant, businesses need cybersecurity warriors who think like attackers. This helps predict and prevent malicious attacks on computer systems. The pentester, acting as a friendly hacker, infiltrates networks to evaluate their strength and proposes fixes. :shield:

## Intrusion Tests & Vulnerability Scans üîç

Imagine being a virtual burglar‚Äîit's like that! Penetration tests (pentests) involve stepping into a hacker's shoes. This means scrutinizing targets like IPs, apps, or even entire networks. :mag_right:

Distinct from pentesting, vulnerability scans are like a warm-up. They identify potential weaknesses without exploring if they can be exploited.

Penetration tests have three goals:

1. **Identify Vulnerabilities:** Spot system or application weaknesses.
2. **Assess Risk Level:** Gauge how risky these vulnerabilities are.
3. **Propose Fixes:** Suggest solutions to strengthen the system. :muscle:

## Pentesting Steps üöÄ

1. **Pre-engagement:** :thought_balloon: Often ignored, this phase outlines the test's scope and approach.
2. **Reconnaissance:** :world_map: Gather public info about the target.
3. **Enumeration/Scanning:** :computer: Discover apps, services, and scan ports (using tools like nmap).
4. **Exploitation:** :dagger: Capitalize on system flaws using existing exploits or logic manipulation.
5. **Privilege Escalation:** :elevator: After a successful breach, expand your access‚Äîhorizontally or vertically.
6. **Post-exploitation:** :exclamation: This phase includes:

   - **Full Privilege Collection:** :key: Gather more data with high-privileged access.
   - **Pivoting:** :recycle: Explore other potential targets.
   - **Clean-up:** :broom: Erase intrusion traces.
   - **Reporting:** :memo: Document findings for the final phase.
   - **Remediation:** :wrench: Suggest fixes for identified vulnerabilities.
