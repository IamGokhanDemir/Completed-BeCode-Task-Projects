## Introduction

A cybersecurity professional, known as a pentester, examines the security of computer networks through penetration tests. They identify vulnerabilities and suggest corrective actions.

## Role of a Pentester

In a world increasingly susceptible to cyber threats, companies require cybersecurity experts who can think like potential attackers. This enables anticipation and mitigation of malicious flaws and intrusions into their computer systems.

The pentester is a computer security expert tasked with deliberately infiltrating a network or application to assess its security level.

While their approach may resemble that of hackers, pentesters employ similar techniques for the benefit of the company. They conduct penetration tests to evaluate IT security and propose measures to enhance system resilience.

## Intrusion Tests & Vulnerability Scans

A penetration test, or pentest, involves analyzing a target from the perspective of an attacker. This target could be an IP address, an application, a web server, or even an entire network.

Distinct from penetration tests, vulnerability scanning is a component of it. It entails scanning the target to identify vulnerabilities without attempting to qualify or ascertain their exploitability.

Penetration tests have clear objectives:

- Identify vulnerabilities in the information system (IS) or applications.
- Assess the risk level of each identified vulnerability.
- Propose prioritized corrective measures.

Pentesters can gauge vulnerability severity, correction complexity, and prioritize fixes through penetration tests.

These tests can be conducted at various stages in a company's life cycle: during project design, to anticipate attacks; during use, at regular intervals; and post-cyber attack, to prevent recurrence.

Penetration tests can be external (from the internet) or internal (within the LAN). The pentester assesses vulnerabilities and attempts to breach the system, bypassing defense mechanisms like firewalls and antivirus tools.

The pentester's tasks extend beyond computer system intrusions. They encompass comprehensive audits of various company equipment:

- **Code Audits:** Analyzing application source code to identify security flaws.
- **Configuration Audits:** Comparing system/network configurations to official references to identify compliance gaps.
- **Architecture Audits:** Evaluating the robustness of an information system's architecture against threats.
- **Organizational Audits:** Assessing the security-oriented organization of a company, including incident management structures.

## Pentesting Steps

1. **Pre-engagement:** Often overlooked, this phase defines the test's scope and methods.
2. **Reconnaissance:** Gathering public information about the target.
3. **Enumeration/Scanning:** Identifying applications, services, and scanning ports (using tools like nmap).
4. **Exploitation:** Exploiting system/application vulnerabilities, either via public exploits or logic manipulation.
5. **Privilege Escalation:** Expanding access post-exploitation, either horizontally (to users with similar permissions) or vertically (to admin privileges).
6. **Post-exploitation:** This phase includes:

   - **Full Privilege Collection:** Gathering more data with high-privileged user access.
   - **Pivoting:** Exploring other potential targets.
   - **Clean-up:** Erasing intrusion traces.
   - **Reporting:** Documenting findings for the final phase.
   - **Remediation:** Proposing fixes for identified vulnerabilities.
