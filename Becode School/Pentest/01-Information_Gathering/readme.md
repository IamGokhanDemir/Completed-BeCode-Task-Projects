## The Mission üöÄ

In the realm of pentesting, information gathering is the compass that guides your exploration. This phase revolves around collecting details about your target. It's vital to differentiate between passive information gathering (reconnaissance) and active information gathering (enumeration).

### Instructions :clipboard:

Your mission entails mastering both of these phases:

- **Passive Information Gathering (Reconnaissance)** üïµÔ∏è
  This involves quietly gathering publicly available information about the target. Your digital detective skills will be put to the test.

- **Active Information Gathering (Enumeration)** üîç
  This step gets livelier as you identify applications, services, and even scan ports using tools like nmap.

## So, What's the Difference?

Technically, reconnaissance and enumeration are two sides of the same coin‚Äîinformation gathering. However, the key distinction lies in the approach. Reconnaissance is all about passive data collection, while enumeration takes a more active approach.
