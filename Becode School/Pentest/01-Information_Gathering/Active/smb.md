# 📂 Samba Enumeration

## 🤖 What is a Samba Server?

A Samba server is like a multilingual mediator in the world of computer systems. It allows different systems, often incompatible by nature, to talk to each other and share resources. Samba, licensed under the GNU General Public License, enables the implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, also known as CIFS (Common Internet File System). Originally used in Windows LANs, SMB allows interaction with file servers, printers, and more.

With Samba, systems running Windows, Linux, and Unix can seamlessly exchange data, share printers, and utilize various services. It doesn't matter if the server runs Linux or Unix, as modern Samba versions even support the role of Active Directory Domain Controllers, enabling centralized authorization and authentication for individual computers and users.

The IP servers are currently down but here are some commands that you can use to perform these tasks

- U can use this command to find the hostname: `nmblookup -A "IP target" `
- Use this command to scan IP networks for NetBIOS name info. It checks each address in the range, showing IP, computer name, user, and MAC for responsive hosts. `nbtscan "IP target"`
- This nmap script finds NetBIOS names and MAC addresses, displaying computer names, logged-in users, and flags studied in nmblookup. `nmap --script nbstat.nse "IP target"`
-
