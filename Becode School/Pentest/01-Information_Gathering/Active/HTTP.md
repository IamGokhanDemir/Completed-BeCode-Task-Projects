# HTTP Enumeration: Unveiling Web Servers and Applications 🔍🌐

In this section, we'll explore various tools and techniques for enumerating information from HTTP services. These tools help us discover details about web servers, applications, and potential vulnerabilities.

## Gobuster: Directory and Subdomain Enumeration 🚀

**Gobuster** is a versatile command-line tool available on both Windows and Linux. It stands out as one of the most comprehensive tools for HTTP enumeration. Here's why it's exceptional:

1. **Multiple Modes**: Gobuster offers three primary modes:
   - **dir**: For brute-forcing directories and files.
   - **dns**: For DNS subdomain brute-forcing.
   - **vhost**: For virtual host brute-forcing (not the same as DNS!).

2. **Simplicity and Speed**: Gobuster is user-friendly, blazing fast, and outperforms its competitors like Dirbuster, Dirb, or Metasploit's equivalent tools.

3. **Advanced Options**: It provides various options, such as adding extensions, brute-forcing HTTP POST and GET parameters, and more.

Here's how you can run Gobuster in each mode:

```bash
# Directory brute-forcing mode
gobuster dir -u http://target-url -w wordlist.txt

# DNS subdomain brute-forcing mode
gobuster dns -d target-domain -w wordlist.txt

# Virtual host brute-forcing mode
gobuster vhost -u http://target-url -w wordlist.txt
```

Each mode serves specific purposes, such as discovering hidden directories, subdomains, or virtual hosts.

### Gobuster Flags

- `-k` (Skip SSL Verification): Useful for self-signed SSL certificates.
- `-s` (Positive Status Codes): Specify valid status codes.
- `-b` (Negative Status Codes): Override valid status codes with a blacklist.
- `-x` (Extensions): Specify file extensions to search for.
- `-r` (Follow Redirects): Follow HTTP redirects.
- `-c` (Cookies): Provide cookies for requests.
- `-H` (HTTP Headers): Add custom HTTP headers.
- `-o` (Output File): Save results to a file.
- `-t` (Threads): Set the number of concurrent threads.
- And more!

## Other Useful Tools 🛠️

1. **Curl**: A command-line tool for making HTTP requests. It's handy for quickly fetching web content and viewing HTTP headers. To check the server version, you can use a command like `curl -I http://target-url`.

2. **Wappalyzer**: A browser extension that identifies technologies used on websites. It detects content management systems, web servers, JavaScript frameworks, and more.

3. **Nikto**: A web server security scanner that checks for vulnerabilities, CGI vulnerabilities, and more. Nikto is especially useful for auditing web servers and applications.

4. **Wordlists**: Use various wordlists to discover hidden content. Some common ones include `/usr/share/wordlists` in Kali Linux, Daniel Miessler's SecLists, and others.
