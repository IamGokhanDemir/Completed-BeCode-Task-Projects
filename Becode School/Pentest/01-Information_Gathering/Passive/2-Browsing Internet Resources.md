🌐 **Website**

The first step in gathering information is to explore the company's website. This can yield valuable details for an attack, such as the software the company uses and contact information for employees, which could be used in social engineering attacks. Look for web pages like "About Us," "Jobs," or "Careers" as they often provide employee names, phone numbers, and email addresses. This information can be quite useful for social engineering. Additionally, a "Jobs" or "Careers" page might reveal active job listings, providing insights into the technologies the company uses. For instance, if there's a job posting for an Exchange Server 2016 email administrator, it suggests that the company likely operates Exchange Server 2016.

📱 **Social Media**

Billions of people have profiles on social networking sites, and many upload content rich in data. For instance, a single image posted on a social networking platform may contain geolocation data, metadata, and camera serial numbers. While social media intelligence doesn't cover all internet data, it's actionable and often helps law enforcement in criminal cases by connecting data fragments to determine a suspect's activities and whereabouts. These data fragments can come from images, videos, location check-ins, and tags across various social media platforms.

🔍 **Whois**

Whois is a search service offered by internet registries to obtain information about an IP address or domain name. Domains are frequently purchased and transferred, involving a simple procedure that costs about $7, depending on the registration service provider. To carry out a Whois lookup, you need to provide additional information about yourself during domain setup, some of which is stored in a Whois record. Notably, the content requested from registrars is not verified, so the data could be inaccurate.

Each Whois record has various sections, including "registrar," "registrant," "administrator," and "technical," each corresponding to different contacts for the registration. Although this data is typically duplicated across sections, discrepancies may arise, especially due to errors. Analysts can use Whois records to identify or connect entities based on unique data shared within these records.

### Example :

To carry out your research you have the possibility of using certain sites dedicated to that like: [https://whois.domaintools.com/](https://whois.domaintools.com/), but you can also do it via the terminal by typing the command whois.

🌐 **Subdomains**

Discovering subdomains is vital for recognizing potential vulnerabilities. Unsecured subdomains can pose serious risks. Some recent incidents have involved hackers exploiting vulnerable subdomains, such as the Vine site, where the entire code was exposed for download from an unprotected subdomain.

**Tools for Subdomain Discovery:**

- **DNS Dumpster**: This tool provides domain-related information, including subdomains, DNS server details, MX records, TXT records, and domain mapping.

- **Sublist3r**: A Python tool for finding subdomains using various search engines, including Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu, Ask, Netcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd, DNSdumpster, and PassiveDNS.

🔍 **Recon-ng**

Recon-ng is a comprehensive reconnaissance framework designed for open-source web-based reconnaissance. It offers a powerful environment for conducting reconnaissance quickly and thoroughly. While it shares a similar look and feel with the Metasploit Framework, Recon-ng is specialized for web-based open-source reconnaissance. It's not intended to compete with other frameworks but focuses exclusively on reconnaissance.
