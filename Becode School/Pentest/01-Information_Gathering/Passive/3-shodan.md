## What is Shodan? 🤔

Shodan is like a supercharged search engine for the internet. While traditional search engines are great for finding websites, Shodan excels at something more profound. It helps you find and list all sorts of internet-connected devices, including surveillance cameras, industrial control systems, printers, and even refrigerators - in other words, everything related to the Internet of Things (IoT).

Shodan doesn't show you the content of these devices; instead, it reveals the information they disclose. This includes device names, locations, IP addresses, ports in use, and more. Shodan collects this data into banners, creating a comprehensive metadata repository of internet-connected devices.

Moreover, Shodan doesn't limit itself to just the web - it covers the entire internet! 🌐

## How Does Shodan Work? 🚀

Let's explore how you can use Shodan:

### 1. Web Interface 🌐

The easiest way to use Shodan is through its web interface. You can find straightforward tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7PIyCq_VU4) to get started. Shodan's [Help Center](https://help.shodan.io/) provides detailed documentation.

### 2. Command Line Interface (CLI) 💻

We'll delve into this method shortly.

### 3. API Integration 🤖

You can directly use Shodan's API to automate tasks within your scripts. We'll touch on this briefly.

**Quick Tips:**
- Regardless of the method, you'll need to create an account. Free accounts have limitations, and premium features require a subscription.
- Shodan is a search engine, so it works with keywords. Check out the [Basic Query](https://help.shodan.io/the-basics/search-query-fundamentals) documentation for using keywords effectively.

## CLI (Command Line Interface) - Let's Dive In! 🌊

Before we get started with the CLI, let's set up your account and install the necessary tools.

### Registration 📝

- Register on Shodan: [link](https://account.shodan.io/register)
- Provide your username, password, and email address.
- Check your email and activate your account.

### Installation 🔧

To use the CLI, you'll need to install the Shodan Python library. Run this command:

```bash
pip3 install -U --user shodan
```

### API Key 🗝️

To fully set up your account and use the CLI, you'll need an API key:

- Go to your API Key page: [Link](https://account.shodan.io/)
- Copy your API key:


- Initialize Shodan with your API key using this command:

```bash
shodan init YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Basic Search 🔍

- To get started, check the available commands:

```bash
shodan -h
```

- Perform a basic search:

```bash
shodan search YOUR REQUEST
```

- To improve the results, you can specify fields:

```bash
shodan search --fields org YOUR REQUEST
```

- For even more specific results, select relevant fields like IP address, port, and organization:

```bash
shodan search --fields ip_str,port,org YOUR REQUEST
```

- Note that search filters are not available in the CLI with a free account.

### Download Results 📥

- To download results, use this command:

```bash
shodan download --limit 10 check YOUR REQUEST
```

- The `--limit` flag allows you to limit the number of results (use `-1` for all possible results).

- Once downloaded, parse the results:

```bash
shodan parse --fields ip_str,port,org check.json.gz
```

## Practice Challenge 🏆

**Type:** Solo

**Duration:** 2 days

**Prerequisites:** Python + Shodan API

**Instructions:** You will create a Python script to replicate a search similar to the one performed in the CLI tutorial.

Your script must:

- Accept user input from the terminal.
- Execute a search based on the input.
- Identify if any vulnerabilities are present.
- Download the first 10 results in a JSON file.
- Refine the results to keep only the IP, port, organization, and hostnames.
- Display the refined results.
