## 🤔 What is WordPress?

WordPress is a 🆓 free, open-source content management system (CMS). This software, written in PHP, relies on a 🗃️ MySQL database and is supported by the WordPress.org foundation. WordPress's versatile features enable you to create and manage various types of websites, including:
- 💼 Business sites
- 📚 Blogs
- 🎨 Portfolios
- 🛒 Online stores
- 🏫 Educational sites

📘 It's distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL version 2 license and serves as the foundation for the multi-site service at WordPress.com, powering millions of websites worldwide. In fact, WordPress powers a staggering 43% of the web, making it the preferred choice for bloggers, small businesses, and even Fortune 500 companies.

## 🏢 Site Management and Administration

WordPress is designed for flexible deployment, whether on your personal computer, office computer, or intranet. You can access and modify your website's content 🌐 remotely through its web server or shared hosting. Installation and updates are quick and hassle-free.

Multiple users can collaborate on your WordPress site, each with their own profile and access rights:
- 👑 Administrator: Full access to all WordPress features, created during installation.
- ✍️ Editor: Can publish and manage their pages and those of other users.
- ✒️ Author: Can only publish and manage their posts.
- 📝 Contributor: Can write and manage their articles but can't publish them.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Subscriber: Manages their profile and information.

## 🔒 WPScan

WPScan is a powerful tool 🛠️ that helps you identify security issues on your WordPress site. It performs various checks, such as:
- ✔️ Verifying the WordPress version for vulnerabilities
- 🔄 Checking themes and plugins for updates and vulnerabilities
- 🔍 Scanning for TimThumb issues
- 📂 Examining configuration backups and database exports
- 🤖 Conducting brute force attacks, and more.

WPScan can be used in several ways:
- 🐧 Installing on Linux servers
- 🐳 Using Docker
- 🦉 Utilizing pre-installed Linux distributions like Kali Linux, BackBox, Pentoo, BlackArch, etc.
- 🌐 Accessing the online version

### 📥 Installation

The beauty of Kali Linux is that WPScan comes pre-installed. Here's how to run the scanner:
1. Log in to Kali Linux as root with the terminal open.
2. Run the scan using the `wpscan` command:

```bash
wpscan --url https://mysite.com
```

Could not perform the scans with WPScan sinds the website is down. Here are some commands I used in the Kali Linux terminal:

-  `wpscan --url 10.12.1.60` : this scans the complete website
- ` wpscan --url 10.12.1.60 --enumerate vt`: Adding the `--vt` scans for  vulnerable Plugins in the website
