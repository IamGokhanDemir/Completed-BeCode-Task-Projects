## Pentesting Steps :triangular_flag_on_post:

- **Pre-engagement Phase** :beginner::dart: - This phase is often underestimated but sets the stage by defining the test's scope and methods.

- **Reconnaissance** :world_map::telescope: - Time to become virtual detectives. Gather all publicly available info about the target to reveal potential weak spots.

- **Enumeration/Scanning** :computer::mag: - Get your scanner ready! Identify running applications, services, and scan ports using tools like nmap.

- **Exploitation** :bomb::pick: - Spot vulnerabilities and get creative. Exploit system/application weaknesses‚Äîthink of it as solving real-world puzzles.

- **Privilege Escalation** :key::elevator: - Gain a foothold? Aim higher! Elevate access from user to admin privileges.

- **Post-exploitation** :leftwards_arrow_with_hook::white_check_mark: - This phase includes:

   - **Full Privilege Collection** :closed_lock_with_key::notebook: - Gather extra data as a high-privileged user.
   - **Pivoting** :left_right_arrow::dart: - Explore other potential targets within the compromised network.
   - **Clean-up** :broom::no_entry_sign: - Erase intrusion traces.
   - **Reporting** :clipboard::page_facing_up: - Document findings for the next phase.
   - **Remediation** :wrench::shield: - Suggest fixes for identified vulnerabilities.

## The Mission üöÄ

Penetration testing is a versatile security assessment methodology. As security extends across domains (web apps, mobile, infrastructure, etc.), it's natural to have multiple tools and frameworks!

In this briefing, you'll explore these frameworks that will become your go-to guides.

I suggest starting with these:

- [OSSTMM](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf)
- [NIST 800-115](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf)
- [PTES](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/PTES_Technical_Guidelines)
- OWASP
    - [Web Application](https://github.com/OWASP/wstg/tree/master/document)
    - [Firmware](https://github.com/scriptingxss/owasp-fstm)
    - [Mobile Security](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs)
    - [Mobile Application Security](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg)
- [Penetration Testing Framework 0.59](http://www.vulnerabilityassessment.co.uk/Penetration%20Test.html)
- [ISSAF](https://sourceforge.net/projects/isstf/files/issaf%20document/issaf0.1/)

### Instructions :clipboard:

- Glance through the provided links. Don't get lost in the details; aim for an overview. Summaries should suffice.
- Hunt for additional frameworks covering various application areas.
- Create a table with frameworks and their application domains. This cheat sheet will be gold!

## Congrats üéâ

You've taken your first steps into the world of pentesting! The references you encounter here will be your companions throughout your career. Keep them handy!
