## The Mission ðŸš€

Pentesting is all about ensuring security, but you must operate within the legal boundaries to protect yourself. Every step of your pentest journey should be sanctioned by the appropriate authority within the company.

Your task is to define workflows and templates of documents that would guide your professional pentest. This seemingly less thrilling part is crucial to safeguarding yourself as you acquire knowledge that could have legal implications.

### Instructions :clipboard:

Here are some questions to guide you:

- What are the standard steps of a pentest?
- Who are the key individuals you'll be interacting with? What are their roles? Are they familiar with IT matters?
- What outcomes should be expected from a pentest?
- What metrics will be used to evaluate the pentest report?

Key points to consider:

- Timing
- Impact of tests on business operations
- Risk indicators
- Providing quotes for each vulnerability fix might be beneficial from a business perspective

Structure your documents as follows:

- "Pentest Agreement"
- "Workflow Communication Schematics"
- "Pentest Report Agreement"
- Feel free to add any extensions you find useful

Ensure your documents look professional and can be adapted for various clients and pentests.

The objective is to help you comprehend the importance of establishing a lawful framework around your testing procedure. These documents could be valuable as you launch your pentesting career.
