## Steps in Pentesting :triangular_flag_on_post:

1. **Pre-engagement Phase** :beginner::dart: - This step is where it all starts. It shapes the test's scope and the methods we'll employ. It's like the foundation of a building‚Äîeverything else relies on it.

2. **Reconnaissance** :world_map::telescope: - Here, we turn into virtual investigators, gathering as much public information as possible about the target. This helps us discover potential weak points.

3. **Enumeration/Scanning** :computer::mag: - We put on our detective hats again and identify the applications and services running on the systems. It's like peeking through various "doors" (ports) to see what's inside, using tools like nmap.

4. **Exploitation** :bomb::pick: - When we find a vulnerability, it's time to get creative. We exploit these weaknesses in the system or application. Think of it as solving puzzles with real-world consequences.

5. **Privilege Escalation** :key::elevator: - After gaining a foothold, we might want to go higher. This means elevating our access to more powerful levels‚Äîlike moving from a regular user to an administrator.

6. **Post-exploitation** :leftwards_arrow_with_hook::white_check_mark: - This phase is multi-faceted:

   - **Full Privilege Collection** :closed_lock_with_key::notebook: - We gather extra data while operating as a high-privileged user.
   - **Pivoting** :left_right_arrow::dart: - We explore other potential targets within the compromised network.
   - **Clean-up** :broom::no_entry_sign: - We clean up after ourselves, making sure there are no traces left behind.
   - **Reporting** :clipboard::page_facing_up: - We document every step meticulously. This is like writing our detective's log.
   - **Remediation** :wrench::shield: - We put on our problem-solving hats again, suggesting solutions to the vulnerabilities we've uncovered.
