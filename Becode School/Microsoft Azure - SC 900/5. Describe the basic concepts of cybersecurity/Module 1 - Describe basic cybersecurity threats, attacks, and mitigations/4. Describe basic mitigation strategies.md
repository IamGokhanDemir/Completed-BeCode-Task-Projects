## **🛡️ Basic Cybersecurity Defenses**

Defending against cyberattacks is crucial. Learn about key strategies to safeguard your organization from cyber threats.

### **🔐 Mitigation Strategies**

Mitigation strategies are measures to prevent or defend against cyberattacks. They include:

1. **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Requires multiple proofs of identity.
   - Uses something user knows, has, or is.
   - Enhances security even if password is compromised.

2. **Browser Security**
   - Implement security policies for browsers.
   - Block unauthorized extensions and add-ons.
   - Keep browsers updated and restrict installations.

3. **Educate Users**
   - Train users to recognize malicious content.
   - Teach safe data handling and sharing.
   - Raise awareness about social engineering attacks.

4. **Threat Intelligence**
   - Collect data on vulnerabilities and attacks.
   - Use insights to implement effective security policies.
   - Automate threat detection and response.

### **🔍 Mitigation in Action**

Imagine a bank that uses these strategies:

- When customers log in, MFA requires a security code from their phones.
- Browsers are locked down, allowing only secure installations.
- Regular workshops educate bank employees about phishing emails.
- Threat intelligence tools track potential threats and vulnerabilities.

These measures collectively form a robust defense, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
