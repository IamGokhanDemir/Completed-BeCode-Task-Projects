# Mastering Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) in Azure AD üîê

Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) is a lifesaver in the realm of identity management. It empowers users to change or reset their passwords without involving administrators or help desks, boosting both productivity and security.

Here's how SSPR works:

**1. Scenarios Supported**:

   - **Password Change**: When users want to change their password voluntarily.
   - **Password Reset**: For times when users can't sign in due to forgotten passwords.
   - **Account Unlock**: When an account gets locked out.

**2. Prerequisites for Users**:

   - Must have an Azure AD license.
   - Admins need to enable SSPR for the users.
   - Users should be registered with chosen authentication methods (recommended: two or more).

**3. Available Authentication Methods**:

   - **Mobile App Notification**: Get a notification on a mobile app.
   - **Mobile App Code**: Generate a code on a mobile app.
   - **Email**: Use your email address for verification.
   - **Mobile Phone**: Get a text message with a code.
   - **Office Phone**: Receive a code via a phone call.
   - **Security Questions**: Answer preset questions for verification (only during SSPR).

**4. Admins and SSPR**:

   - Admins are auto-enabled for SSPR but can't use security questions.
   - Admins need two authentication methods for SSPR (email, authenticator app, or phone number).

**5. Password Write-Back**:

   - When users change passwords via SSPR, changes can be written back to on-premises Active Directory.
   - Ensures seamless access to on-premises resources using updated credentials.

**6. Email Notifications**:

   - Admins can set up email notifications for SSPR events (for both regular users and admin accounts).
   - This adds an extra layer of awareness, especially for privileged admin account password resets.

SSPR streamlines identity management, reduces dependency on help desks, and strengthens security. So, next time you forget your password or get locked out, remember the power of SSPR!
