## **🗂️ Retention Policies and Labels: Managing Information Smartly**

Efficiently managing data's lifecycle is crucial for organizations. Microsoft Purview offers **Retention Policies and Labels** as your allies in this endeavor. Let's delve into their power in a clear and concise way.

### **1. What are Retention Policies and Labels?** 📆

Retaining and deleting content systematically is key. Retention Policies and Labels help organizations to:

- **Comply Proactively:** Keep content as required by regulations or internal policies.
- **Mitigate Risk:** Permanently delete old content to safeguard against litigation or security breaches.
- **Enable Focused Work:** Users interact with current and relevant content effortlessly.

### **2. How Retention Settings Work** 🕒

Retention settings smoothly operate within various workloads:

- SharePoint and OneDrive
- Microsoft Teams
- Yammer
- Exchange

Content with retention settings stays put, allowing users to continue their work seamlessly. Edits or deletions are secured; copies are stored in protected locations, maintaining user productivity.

### **3. Retention Policies vs. Retention Labels** 📛

**Retention Policies:**

- Applied to entire sites or mailboxes.
- One policy for multiple locations or specific users.
- Content inherits settings from the policy's container.

**Retention Labels:**

- Assigned to individual items like documents or emails.
- One label per item.
- Labels move with content within Microsoft 365.

### **4. Using Retention Policies and Labels** 📝

**Scenarios:**

- **Efficient Policy:** Keep all documents in a SharePoint site for 5 years? Use a retention policy.
- **Mixed Durations:** Some for 5 years, some for 10? Policy for the site (5 years) + label for specific items (10 years).

**Additional Notes:**

- Labels can be set manually or automatically based on conditions.
- Default label for SharePoint docs can be configured.
- Labels support disposition review before permanent deletion.
