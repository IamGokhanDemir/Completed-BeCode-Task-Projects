Security threat prevention is not limited to just network security. It also covers applications, email, collaborations, endpoints, cross SaaS solutions, identity, and more. With the integrated Microsoft 365 Defender solution, security professionals can stitch together the threat signals that each of these products receive and determine the full scope and impact of the threat; how it entered the environment, what it's affected, and how it's currently impacting the organization.
