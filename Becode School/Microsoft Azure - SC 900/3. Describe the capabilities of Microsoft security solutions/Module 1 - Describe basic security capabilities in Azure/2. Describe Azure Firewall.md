## üõ°Ô∏è Secure Your Azure Network with Azure Firewall

Azure Firewall is your cloud-based defender, shielding your Azure Virtual Network (VNet) resources from malicious attackers. Deploy it within a centralized virtual network to oversee and control traffic flow for all your VNets and on-premises networks across different subscriptions.

### ‚≠ê Key Features:

1. **Built-in High Availability**: No configuration needed! Enjoy automatic high availability, with the option to span across multiple availability zones for extra reliability.

2. **Network & Application Filtering**: Set rules based on IP, port, protocol, and even fully qualified domain names. Control outbound HTTP(s) traffic and manage network filtering with precision.

3. **Outbound SNAT & Inbound DNAT**: Seamlessly translate private IP addresses to Azure public IPs (SNAT) for outbound traffic, and vice versa (DNAT) for inbound traffic. Filter and regulate connections to internet resources.

4. **Multiple Public IP Addresses**: Associate multiple public IP addresses with Azure Firewall for enhanced flexibility.

5. **Threat Intelligence**: Enable threat intelligence-based filtering to block traffic to and from known malicious IP addresses and domains. Stay proactive against emerging threats.

6. **Integration with Azure Monitor**: Leverage Azure Monitor to gather, analyze, and take action on telemetry from Azure Firewall logs. Gain insights into network security.

### üöÄ Advantages:

- **Scalability**: Azure Firewall grows with your network traffic needs, eliminating the need to budget for peak usage.
- **Centralized Control**: Manage traffic for all VNets and on-premises networks through a single point, boosting security and control.
- **Efficient Resource Protection**: Safeguard Azure resources within connected VNets using Azure Firewall's robust capabilities.
