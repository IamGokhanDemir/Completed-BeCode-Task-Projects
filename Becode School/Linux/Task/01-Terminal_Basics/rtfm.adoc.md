# RTFM - Read the Frickin' Manual

**Type of challenge:** Learning

**Duration:** 60 min

**Team Challenge:** Solo

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this challenge, you should be able to:

- Read the manual of commands
- Find out what a command does
- Understand the help flag

## The Mission

The terminal can be intimidating with all these commands and text flying around. It's an all-new world, a textual interface with rules very different from a more familiar graphical interface. Luckily, there are tools like `man` to guide you in this new environment.

1. **Open a terminal**: Launch your preferred terminal application. This could be Terminal on macOS, GNOME Terminal on Linux, or Command Prompt on Windows.

2. **Type `man man`**: Enter the command `man man` in the terminal. The `man` command opens the manual for the `man` command itself.

The `man` command is used to access the manual pages for various commands and topics. It provides detailed information, explanations, and examples about the command or topic you're interested in.

3. **Hit the `h` key**: While viewing the manual for `man`, press the `h` key on your keyboard. This will display the help page within the manual.

4. **Leave the manual**: To exit the manual and return to the terminal, press the `q` key.

You might have guessed it, `man` opens the manual for the desired page. Although it can be technical, it remains one of the best places to learn. However, if you simply want a description, let's try using `whatis`.

5. **Type `whatis man`**: Enter the command `whatis man` in the terminal. The `whatis` command provides a brief description of the `man` command.

6. **Type `whatis whatis`**: Enter the command `whatis whatis` in the terminal. This command will provide a concise description of the `whatis` command itself.

The `whatis` command is used to display a short description of a command or topic. It provides a quick summary of what the command does.

7. **Type `whatis --help`**: Enter the command `whatis --help` in the terminal. The `--help` flag is a common convention used by many commands to provide a brief overview of the command's usage and available options.

The `--help` flag is used to display the built-in help message for a command. It provides information on how to use the command and its various options.

8. **Practice by learning about `ls`, `cp`, and `pwd`**: Use the `man` command to explore the manual pages for the `ls`, `cp`, and `pwd` commands. Read through the descriptions, options, and examples to understand what each command does.

Optional:

An alternative to the `man` command is `info`. Do some research to learn more about their differences.

## Explanation

In this challenge, you are introduced to the concept of reading manuals and understanding commands in the terminal. The `man` command is used to access the detailed documentation for various commands, providing explanations, examples, and usage information. The `whatis` command provides brief descriptions of commands, allowing you to quickly understand their purpose. The `--help` flag is a common way to access the built-in help message for a command, providing a concise overview of its usage and options. By following the given instructions and exploring the manuals, you will gain a better understanding of how to navigate and utilize the terminal environment.
