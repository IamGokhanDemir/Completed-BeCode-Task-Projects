# Linux Network Services Setup - Project Completion

This project involved setting up Linux network services using virtual machines without a graphical user interface (GUI). The goal was to demonstrate the functionality of Linux and showcase various network services like DHCP, DNS, HTTP, and MariaDB. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Project Overview

- A Linux server and a workstation were configured using virtual machines to simulate a network environment.
- The server was set up to provide essential services like DHCP, DNS, HTTP, and MariaDB.
- The workstation was configured with a desktop environment and applications such as LibreOffice, GIMP, and Mullvad browser.
- Additional optional features, like remote assistance for users, were proposed and implemented.

## Accomplishments

- **Server Configuration**:
  - Ubuntu Server was installed on a virtual machine without a GUI.
  - The network settings were manually configured, including the IP address and subnet mask.
  - Required services, including DHCP, DNS, HTTP, and MariaDB, were successfully installed and configured.
  - A weekly backup script was created to archive configuration files.
  - Remote management (SSH) was enabled, allowing remote access to the server.

- **Workstation Configuration**:
  - Kali Linux was installed on another virtual machine without a GUI.
  - The workstation was successfully connected to the internal network.
  - Applications like LibreOffice, GIMP, and Mullvad browser were installed.

- **Documentation and Demonstration**:
  - Detailed documentation was created, providing step-by-step instructions, explanations, and reasoning behind each configuration step.
  - The setup was successfully demonstrated, showcasing the working functionality of all required items.
  - Optional features, such as remote assistance for users, were demonstrated if implemented.

## Evaluation

The project will be evaluated based on the quality of documentation, successful implementation of required items, optional items, organization, planning, and knowledge demonstrated during the presentation. The provided documentation file (e.g., LinuxNetworkServicesSetup.md) contains detailed instructions and explanations for each step.

## Next Steps

Feel free to explore and expand upon the setup by adding more functionality or experimenting with different configurations. The virtual machines can serve as a learning environment for further exploration of Linux and network services.
