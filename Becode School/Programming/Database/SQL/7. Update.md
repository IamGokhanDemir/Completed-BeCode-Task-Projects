## SQL Lesson 17: Altering tables

With its power, you can shape and transform your tables as your data evolves over time! 🛠️💪

**Adding New Columns** ➕📚
To expand your table's knowledge, you can add new columns using the ALTER TABLE statement:

```sql
ALTER TABLE mytable
ADD column DataType OptionalTableConstraint 
    DEFAULT default_value;
```

You shall specify the data type, constraints, and default values for the new column. It shall apply to both existing and future rows, empowering your table with newfound wisdom! 📚🌟

**Removing Columns** ➖❌
When the time comes to part ways with a column, you can bid it farewell using the ALTER TABLE statement:

```sql
ALTER TABLE mytable
DROP column_to_be_deleted;
```

However, some databases may lack this feature, requiring you to create a new table and migrate the data like a well-orchestrated dance. 💃🔀

**Renaming the Table** 🏷️📛
Should you desire to bestow a new name upon your table, you can do so with the RENAME TO clause:

```sql
ALTER TABLE mytable
RENAME TO new_table_name;
```

Lo, the table shall embrace its new identity and respond to the new name henceforth! 📛✨

**The Ever-changing World of SQL** 🌌🔍
Alas, each database implementation may have its own unique ways to alter tables, so consult the sacred database docs before you embark on these changes: MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server. 📚🔮

Now, young SQL adventurers, with the ALTER TABLE statement in your grasp, you can shape your tables like clay and adapt to the ever-changing currents of data! 🌊🏰🌟
