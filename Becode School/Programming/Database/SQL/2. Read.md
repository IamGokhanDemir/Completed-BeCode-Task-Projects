## 📚 **SQL Lesson 1: SELECT Queries 101**

To get data from a SQL database, we write SELECT statements, also called queries. A query is like a special request that tells the database what information we want, where to find it, and how we want it presented. The syntax, or format, for writing queries is specific, and we'll learn about it in the exercises.

🗂️ In SQL, think of a table as a group of related things (e.g., Dogs), and each row in that table represents a specific thing from that group (e.g., a pug, a beagle, etc.). The columns in the table are like the shared properties of all those things (e.g., color of fur, length of tail).

🔍 Let's start with a basic query that selects specific columns (properties) from the table, but includes all rows (instances).

**Select query for specific columns:**
```sql
SELECT column, another_column, ...
FROM mytable;
```
The result will be a table showing only the columns we requested, but containing all the rows from the original table.

🌟 And if we want to get ALL the columns from a table, we can use the asterisk (*) symbol as a shorthand!

**Select query for all columns:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM mytable;
```
This query is super handy because it gives us a complete view of the table's data all at once. It's like opening a treasure chest filled with valuable information! 💎🗝️

## 📚 **SQL Lesson 2: Queries with Constraints (Part 1)**

Now that we know how to select specific columns from a table, imagine if the table had a massive number of rows, like a hundred million! It would be inefficient and overwhelming to read through all of them.

🎯 This is where the powerful WHERE clause comes in! It allows us to filter results and get only the data we need. The WHERE clause acts like a smart filter, checking specific column values in each row to decide whether to include that row in the results or not.

**Select query with constraints:**
```sql
SELECT column, another_column, ...
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR ...;
```

💡 You can create more complex clauses by using multiple AND or OR keywords. For example:
```sql
num_wheels >= 4 AND doors <= 2
```

🔢 Here are some useful operators to use with numerical data (like integers or floating points):

| Operator       | Condition                                | SQL Example       |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| =, !=, <, <=, >, >= | Standard numerical operators        | col_name != 4      |
| BETWEEN ... AND ... | Number is within a range             | col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5 |
| NOT BETWEEN ... AND ... | Number is not within a range     | col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10 |
| IN (...)       | Number exists in a list               | col_name IN (2, 4, 6)       |
| NOT IN (...)   | Number does not exist in a list | col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5) |

🚀 Using these constraints not only makes the results more manageable, but it also speeds up the query by reducing unnecessary data.

🔍 By the way, SQL doesn't require keywords to be capitalized, but it's a good convention. It helps distinguish keywords from column and table names, making the query easier to read. So keep it in mind! 🧠

## 📚 **SQL Lesson 3: Queries with Constraints (Part 2)**

When working with text data in SQL, we have some cool operators to make our queries even more powerful! These operators help us with case-insensitive comparisons and wildcard pattern matching.

🔡 **Text-data specific operators:**

| Operator | Condition                                   | Example                   |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| =        | Case sensitive exact string comparison     | col_name = "abc"          |
| != or <> | Case sensitive exact string inequality comparison | col_name != "abcd"      |
| LIKE     | Case insensitive exact string comparison   | col_name LIKE "ABC"       |
| NOT LIKE | Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison | col_name NOT LIKE "ABCD" |
| %        | Match a sequence of zero or more characters anywhere in a string (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE) | col_name LIKE "%AT%"   |
| _        | Match a single character anywhere in a string (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE) | col_name LIKE "AN_"    |
| IN (…)   | String exists in a list                   | col_name IN ("A", "B", "C") |
| NOT IN (…) | String does not exist in a list           | col_name NOT IN ("D", "E", "F") |

🎯 **Important Note:** All strings must be quoted in SQL. This helps the query parser distinguish between words in the string and SQL keywords.

🚀 While these operators are quite efficient for most database implementations, it's essential to remember that full-text search (for more complex text searching) is best handled by dedicated libraries like Apache Lucene or Sphinx. These specialized libraries are designed specifically for full-text search and can support advanced features like internationalization and complex queries.

🔍 So, whether you're dealing with simple text comparisons or need more sophisticated search capabilities, SQL has got you covered! Keep exploring and learning! 🌟

## 📚 **SQL Lesson 4: Filtering and Sorting Query Results**

In this lesson, we'll dive into more ways to get exactly what we want from our database!

🔎 **Getting Unique Results:**

Sometimes, the data in a database may have duplicates, but we only want distinct values. To achieve this, we use the `DISTINCT` keyword.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column, another_column, ...
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s);
```

💡 **Sorting Results:**

Real databases don't always have neat order. With `ORDER BY`, we can sort our results based on a specific column, either in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.

```sql
SELECT column, another_column, ...
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC;
```

🌟 **Limiting Results:**

For optimization, we can limit the number of rows returned using `LIMIT`, and with `OFFSET`, we can specify where counting should start.

```sql
SELECT column, another_column, ...
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```

🚀 **Extra Tip:**

`LIMIT` and `OFFSET` help websites like Reddit or Pinterest show links in pages, sorted by popularity and time. This way, the database processes and returns only the requested content, making things faster and efficient.

🎯 **Did You Know?**

`LIMIT` and `OFFSET` are usually applied after other parts of a query, ensuring we get the results we want! In Lesson 12, we'll explore the order of execution with more query parts.

Now you have more powerful tools to get the exact data you need! Keep exploring and making your queries super-efficient! 💪😊

### **SQL Review: Simple SELECT Queries**

Nice work on learning the basics of SQL! Now, let's review the structure of a simple SELECT query:

```sql
SELECT column, another_column, ...
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```

🔍 **SELECT:** This keyword tells the database that we want to retrieve specific columns from the table.

📚 **FROM:** This is where we specify the table from which we want to retrieve the data.

⚖️ **WHERE:** With the WHERE clause, we can set conditions to filter the rows based on specific column values.

📊 **ORDER BY:** By using ORDER BY, we can sort the results either in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order based on a column.

🎯 **LIMIT:** LIMIT helps to restrict the number of rows returned in the result set.

🔢 **OFFSET:** OFFSET allows us to specify where to start counting the rows for the result set.

🚀 **Putting It All Together:**

To use this query, you can replace `column` with the actual names of the columns you want to retrieve, and `mytable` with the name of the table you want to fetch data from. Add any necessary conditions in the WHERE clause to filter the data, and use ORDER BY to sort it. If you need to limit the number of results, use LIMIT and optionally OFFSET.

Keep practicing and solving real-world problems with SQL queries, and you'll become a skilled data wrangler! 📊💪😊

## **SQL Lesson 6: Multi-table queries with JOINs**

Now, let's dive into more advanced SQL concepts. In the real world, data is often split across multiple tables for efficiency and organization. This process is called database normalization. It reduces duplicate data and allows the database to scale effectively.

🔁 **Database Normalization:** Minimizes duplicate data and supports independent growth of data entities.

🔗 **Joining Tables:** When data about a single entity is split across multiple tables, we can use the JOIN clause to combine them. For example, imagine we have a "Cars" table and a "Car_Models" table, both sharing a unique "car_id" column.

```sql
SELECT column, another_table_column, ...
FROM mytable
INNER JOIN another_table 
    ON mytable.car_id = another_table.car_id
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column, … ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```

🚀 **INNER JOIN:** Matches rows from both tables based on the shared key (car_id in this case) and creates a result row with combined columns.

💡 **Did you know?** INNER JOIN and JOIN are the same. We use INNER JOIN to make our queries more readable when using other types of joins.

Now, with JOINs, you can combine data from different tables to answer complex questions about related entities. Keep practicing JOINs, and you'll become a SQL master, handling vast amounts of data efficiently! 🏆📊💻


EXERCISE 6 Multi-table queries with JOINs: [SQLBolt - Learn SQL - SQL Lesson 6: Multi-table queries with JOINs](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_with_joins)


## **SQL Lesson 7: OUTER JOINs**

 Now, let's level up and explore OUTER JOINs. Sometimes, INNER JOIN might not be enough, especially when dealing with asymmetric data. To handle such cases, we have three new types of JOINs: LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.

🔗 **LEFT JOIN:** Includes all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If there's no match in the right table, NULL values are used.

🔗 **RIGHT JOIN:** Similar to LEFT JOIN, but it includes all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.

🔗 **FULL JOIN:** Keeps all rows from both tables, filling in NULL values if there's no match in the other table.

```sql
SELECT column, another_column, ...
FROM mytable
LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN another_table 
    ON mytable.id = another_table.matching_id
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column, … ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```

💡 **Tip:** OUTER keyword is optional and mostly used for SQL-92 compatibility. You can write LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN without OUTER.

When using OUTER JOINs, remember to handle NULL values in your results and add any necessary constraints. With this new knowledge, you can handle even more complex data scenarios and tackle real-world data analysis like a pro! 🚀📈💪

## **SQL Lesson 8: A Short Note on NULLs**

Nulls in SQL databases are special and require careful handling. They represent missing or unknown data and can affect query results and analysis. Here are some important points to consider:

💔 **Avoiding NULLs:** It's good practice to minimize NULL values in your database by using appropriate default values (e.g., 0 for numbers, empty strings for text). This simplifies queries and processing.

💡 **Using NULLs:** Sometimes, you need NULLs to represent incomplete data. For example, when calculating averages, NULLs can be used to avoid skewing results.

⚠️ **Special Attention:** NULLs need special attention in queries. Certain functions behave differently with NULL values, so you must handle them appropriately.

🔍 **Testing for NULLs:** You can use the `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` constraint in a WHERE clause to test if a column contains NULL values.

```sql
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE column IS/IS NOT NULL
AND/OR another_condition
AND/OR …;
```

By understanding and managing NULL values, you can ensure more accurate and reliable results in your database queries and analysis. Happy data handling! 🧰📊🔍

## # SQL Lesson 9: Queries with Expressions

In SQL, you can use **expressions** to do cool stuff with data during a **query**. It's like giving the data some magic powers! 🪄✨

Imagine you have a big table with information about particles and their speeds in a physics experiment. You want to know the speed of each particle, but you also want to know half of that speed. Instead of doing two separate things, SQL lets you perform both tasks in one go!

For example, you can write a query that takes the **particle_speed** and divides it by 2.0 🤓. It's like splitting a cake in half! 🍰🍰 And you can even give this new "half-speed" a special name using the **AS** keyword, like calling it **half_particle_speed**. It's like giving your new result a fancy nickname! 😎

```sql
SELECT particle_speed / 2.0 AS half_particle_speed
FROM physics_data;
```

Oh, but there's more! 🙌 SQL also lets you use functions to do tricks with your data. You can find the absolute value of the **particle_position** (like how far it is from zero) and then multiply it by 10.0. It's like making something look bigger! 🔍🔍

```sql
SELECT ABS(particle_position) * 10.0 AS distance_from_zero
FROM physics_data;
```

Sometimes, we want to use these tricks to filter the results, like getting only the particles that are far away from zero. So we use a **WHERE** statement to do that!

```sql
SELECT particle_speed / 2.0 AS half_particle_speed
FROM physics_data
WHERE ABS(particle_position) * 10.0 > 500;
```

And that's it! You can do lots of magic with SQL expressions, giving your data superpowers and getting exactly what you need! 🌟🔮 Just remember to use **AS** to give your results special names, and you'll become an SQL wizard in no time! 🧙‍♂️🎩✨

## # SQL Lesson 10: Queries with Aggregates (Part 1)

5Now we're going to learn about **aggregate functions** in SQL. These are like powerful tools that help us summarize information about a bunch of rows in a database. 📊📈

Imagine we have a super cool Pixar database with all the movie data. Using aggregate functions, we can answer interesting questions like "How many movies has Pixar produced?" or "Which Pixar movie made the most money each year?" 🎬💰

To use these magic functions, we write special queries with some extra sauce! 🍝 The basic structure looks like this:

```sql
SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_or_expression) AS aggregate_description, …
FROM mytable
WHERE constraint_expression;
```

Wait, what's an aggregate function? 🤔 It's like a superhero command that can do cool stuff with data in a whole group of rows at once! 💪 For example, **COUNT(*)** helps us count all the rows, and **MIN(column)** finds the smallest value in a specific column. There's also **MAX(column)** to find the largest value, **AVG(column)** to calculate the average, and **SUM(column)** to add up all the numbers! 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_movies
FROM pixar_movies;
```

And the magic doesn't stop there! 🎩✨ We can use the **GROUP BY** clause to create smaller groups within our data and apply the aggregate functions to each group separately. It's like sorting our Pixar movies into categories and finding stats for each group! 📂🏆

```sql
SELECT genre, AVG(box_office_sales) AS avg_sales
FROM pixar_movies
GROUP BY genre;
```

With these amazing powers, you'll become a data wizard, answering complex questions with ease! 🌟 So keep practicing, and soon you'll be crunching data like a pro! 🚀📊

### Here are some amazing SQL superpowers! 🌟💪

1. **COUNT(*) or COUNT(column):** This is like a headcount command! It counts how many rows are in the group. If we don't specify a column, it counts all the rows, but we can also count only the rows with non-empty values in a specific column. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

2. **MIN(column):** This is the "smallest hero" function! It finds the smallest number in a specific column for all the rows in the group. It's like finding the tiniest Pixar movie! 🎬🐜

3. **MAX(column):** Meet the "largest hero" function! 🦸‍♂️ It does the opposite of MIN and finds the largest number in a column for all the rows in the group. It's like discovering the biggest Pixar movie! 🎬🐘

4. **AVG(column):** Here comes the "average hero"! It calculates the average (mean) of numbers in a specific column for all the rows in the group. It's like finding the typical box office sales for Pixar movies! 🎬📊

5. **SUM(column):** The "summoner hero"! It adds up all the numbers in a specific column for the rows in the group. It's like finding the total box office earnings for Pixar movies! 💰🍿

You can use these superpowers in your SQL queries to analyze data and get awesome insights! 🚀 For more details and specific examples, check out the documentation for MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server. Have fun using these powers to explore your favorite Pixar movies! 🌟🎉

## SQL Lesson 11: Queries with aggregates (Pt. 2)

Let's dive into the world of powerful HAVING clauses! 💫

Imagine you have a treasure trove of data, but it's so massive that it needs grouping to make sense of it all. We've got our trusty GROUP BY clause to help us with that! But wait, we want to apply more rules to the grouped data! That's where the magical HAVING clause comes in!

Here's how it works: After we group the data using GROUP BY, we can use HAVING to add extra conditions to filter out the groups we want. It's like casting a spell on the groups to keep only the ones that meet specific criteria! ✨🔍

So, with a spell like this:

```sql
SELECT group_by_column, AGG_FUNC(column_expression) AS aggregate_result_alias, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING group_condition;
```

We get to keep only the groups that meet our requirements. It's like having a magic wand to control the grouped data! 🪄💪

And guess what? If you don't use the GROUP BY clause, you can stick to using the regular WHERE clause. But when you're dealing with powerful GROUP BY, HAVING comes to your rescue! 🦸‍♀️🚀

Now go forth, young SQL sorcerer, and conquer those complex queries with the magic of HAVING! You're on your way to becoming a true SQL master! 🌟🎓

## SQL Lesson 12: Order of execution of a Query

Hey there, SQL whiz! Let's uncover the magical order in which a query is executed! 🧙‍♀️✨

1. **FROM and JOINs**: We start by gathering all the data we need from the specified tables, and even create temporary tables if necessary. It's like assembling all the puzzle pieces! 🧩

2. **WHERE**: Next, we apply the WHERE clause to filter out rows that don't meet the conditions. It's like using a sieve to remove unwanted grains of sand! 🕵️‍♂️

3. **GROUP BY**: If we have a GROUP BY clause, we group rows with similar values in the specified column. Think of it as grouping friends with the same favorite color! 🌈

4. **HAVING**: After grouping, we can further filter the groups using the HAVING clause. Only the groups that meet the conditions get to stay! It's like picking only the coolest friend groups! 😎

5. **SELECT**: Time to perform any calculations and expressions in the SELECT part of the query. It's like revealing the final scores after a thrilling game! ⚽🏀

6. **DISTINCT**: Now, we remove any duplicate rows based on the DISTINCT column. No duplicates allowed at this party! 🎉

7. **ORDER BY**: If we specified an ORDER BY clause, we sort the remaining rows in ascending or descending order. It's like arranging friends by height or age! 📏👫

8. **LIMIT / OFFSET**: Lastly, we pick only the rows within the specified range using LIMIT and OFFSET. It's like selecting a few pages from a big book! 📖

And voilà! We have our final set of rows ready to be presented to you! 🎁🎊

Remember, not every query needs all these parts, but with this knowledge, you can create powerful SQL spells to manipulate data with ease! Keep practicing, and you'll become a true SQL wizard in no time! 🧙‍♂️💻✨
