## Ensuring Data Integrity: Entity and Referential Integrity

### 🛡️ **Entity Integrity** 🛡️

Relational databases rely on **entity integrity** to maintain data quality. This is achieved through primary keys that uniquely identify records. Primary keys and their components cannot be null or duplicate, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.

### 🚫 **Entity Integrity Issues** 🚫

For instance, if primary keys are not unique, identifying records becomes problematic. Any operation violating entity integrity—like inserting or updating with null or non-unique primary key values—will be rejected by the DBMS.

### 🔗 **Referential Integrity** 🔗

**Referential integrity** ensures foreign keys link correctly to primary keys. Foreign keys must reference an existing primary key or contain a null value. This prevents orphan records—data with no corresponding primary key.

### 🚧 **Issues with Referential Integrity** 🚧

An update or delete operation on a primary key must be accompanied by the same action on the linked foreign key. This prevents orphan records from forming and maintains data accuracy.

### 📚 **Example: Entity Integrity** 📚

In a table like Publishers, if a row lacks a value for the primary key PublisherID, entity integrity is violated. For example:
```
PublisherID | Name                         | Phone    | Email               | Website
1           | American University in Cairo | NULL     | NULL                | https://aucpress.com/
NULL        | Michigan State University   | NULL     | info@msupress.org   | http://msupress.org/
```

### 📘 **Example: Referential Integrity** 📘

Consider the Authors and BookAuthor tables:
Authors table:
```
AuthorID | LastName  | FirstName
1        | Austen    | Jane
2        | Patterson | James
4        | King      | Stephen
```

BookAuthor table:
```
AuthorID | BookID
1        | 12
2        | 15
3        | 222
4        | 259
```

Here, referential integrity is violated because AuthorID 3 in the BookAuthor table has no corresponding primary key in the Authors table.
