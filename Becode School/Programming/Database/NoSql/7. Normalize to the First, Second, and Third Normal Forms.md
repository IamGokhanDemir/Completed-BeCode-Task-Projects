## 🧩 **Normalization: Building Structured Data**

### 🔍 **Normalizing to 1NF** 🔍

First Normal Form (1NF) is a crucial step that eradicates repeating groups and establishes primary keys, enhancing data clarity and integrity.

### 📌 **1NF Criteria** 📌

To achieve 1NF:

1. Define a **primary key** to uniquely identify records.
2. Eradicate **repeating groups** within the relation.

### 📊 **Starting Point** 📊

Begin with a record collection that can fit in a spreadsheet. For instance, data about books, including available media.

Books Table (Before 1NF)
Title | MediaType
--- | ---
Database Design | Print, e-book
PHP | e-book
Intro to Programming | Print, e-book, Online

### ✨ **Transformation to 1NF** ✨

Create a new table for unique media groups and establish a primary key. Replace repeating values with corresponding IDs.

Books Table (1NF)
(PK) BookID | Title | (FK) MediaID
--- | --- | ---
1 | Database Design | 1
2 | PHP | 2
3 | Intro to Programming | 3

Media Table (1NF)
(PK) MediaID | Media
--- | ---
1 | Print
2 | eBook
3 | Online

### 🔄 **From 1NF to 2NF** 🔄

Second Normal Form (2NF) requires meeting 1NF and eliminating partial dependencies, resulting in properly grouped entities.

### 🎯 **2NF Criteria** 🎯

For 2NF:

1. Be in **1NF**.
2. Remove **partial dependencies**.

### ⚖️ **Partial Dependencies** ⚖️

Partial dependencies occur when attributes depend partially on the primary key. For example, in the Orders table, attributes like OrderDate and CustomerID should fully depend on the primary key, OrderID.

### 📚 **Tables Transformation** 📚

Orders Table (Before 2NF)
OrderID | OrderDate | CustomerID | LastName | Address | BookID | Title | Price | Quantity
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
123 | 2023-07-15 | 456 | Smith | 123 Main St | 789 | Database Design | $50 | 2
124 | 2023-07-16 | 457 | Johnson | 456 Elm St | 790 | PHP | $40 | 1
125 | 2023-07-17 | 458 | Brown | 789 Oak St | 791 | Intro to Programming | $60 | 3

Transformed Tables (2NF)
Orders Table | BooksCost Table | BookOrderQuantity Table
--- | --- | ---
(PK) OrderID | (PK) BookID | (PK) OrderID | (PK) BookID | Quantity
OrderDate | Title | Price
CustomerID |
LastName |
Address |

### 🔗 **Linking Attributes** 🔗

BookID and Quantity are linked through a composite primary key (OrderID and BookID) in the BookOrderQuantity table.

### ⏭️ **Advancing to 3NF** ⏭️

Third Normal Form (3NF) builds on 2NF by eliminating transitive dependencies.

### 🚦 **3NF Criteria** 🚦

For 3NF:

1. Be in **2NF**.
2. Eradicate **transitive dependencies**.

### ⚙️ **Transitive Dependencies** ⚙️

Transitive dependencies arise when attributes rely on other non-key attributes.

### 📑 **Tables Transformation** 📑

Orders Table (Before 3NF)
OrderID | OrderDate | CustomerID | LastName | Address
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
123 | 2023-07-15 | 456 | Smith | 123 Main St
124 | 2023-07-16 | 457 | Johnson | 456 Elm St
125 | 2023-07-17 | 458 | Brown | 789 Oak St

456 | Smith | 123 Main St
457 | Johnson | 456 Elm St

### 🔍 **Closing Thoughts on Normalization** 🔍

Normalization enhances data integrity by eliminating redundancies, partial dependencies, and transitive dependencies, ensuring a well-structured and maintainable database.
