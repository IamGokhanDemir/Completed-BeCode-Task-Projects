# Database Essentials Summary 📚

## Relational Databases vs. NoSQL 🔄
- **Relational DB**: Tables, structured data, SQL queries.
- **NoSQL**: Flexible schema, suitable for unstructured data.

## SQL Server Express Features 🛠️
- **Tables**: Organize data into structured tables.
- **Stored Procedures**: Predefined scripts for tasks.
- **Jobs**: Scheduled tasks at specific times.
- **Triggers**: Automatic actions on data changes.

## Data Types for Precise Storage 📊
- **Numeric**: Numbers, decimals, integers.
- **Date/Time**: Dates, times, durations.
- **Boolean**: Yes/No answers.
- **Text**: Variable text length.

## Ensuring Data Integrity 🛡️
- **Entity Integrity**: Non-null primary keys.
- **Referential Integrity**: Linked foreign keys.

## Normalization for Better Structure 🏗️
1. **1NF**: No repeating groups, unique primary keys.
2. **2NF**: Remove partial dependencies.
3. **3NF**: Eliminate transitive dependencies.
