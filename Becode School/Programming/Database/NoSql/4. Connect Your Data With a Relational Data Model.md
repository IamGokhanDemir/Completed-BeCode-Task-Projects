## Building Logical Structures of Entities

### 🔗 **Relational Data Model** 🔗

The **relational data model** ensures data is managed efficiently by using linked tables. Each table provides access to related data, maintaining data integrity and avoiding potential issues.

### 📦 **Entities and Entity Instances** 📦

**Entities** are single items, such as books, authors, or orders. They correspond to tables in a database. An **entity instance** is a single occurrence of an entity, equivalent to a database record. Entity types group similar entities together.

### 🧩 **Entity Types** 🧩

**Entity types** encompass multiple related tables with similar attributes. For instance, a customer entity type could consist of Customer, Orders, and OrderDetails tables, each containing related data.

### 🔑 **Primary and Foreign Keys** 🔑

- **Primary key:** Uniquely identifies a record in a table. It's usually a numeric value generated by the DBMS upon record insertion.
- **Foreign key:** Also uniquely identifies a record but in a different table. It establishes links between tables.

In diagrams, **PK** represents primary keys, and **FK** represents foreign keys. For example, in an Orders table, the OrderID attribute is the primary key. The CustomerID attribute in the Orders table links to the Customers table, where CustomerID serves as the primary key.

## 📝 **Practice with Multiple Choice Questions** 📝

1. In a relational data model, why are tables linked together?
   - [x] To efficiently manage related data
   - [ ] To increase data redundancy

2. What does an entity instance represent?
   - [ ] A collection of related entities
   - [ ] A database record
   - [ ] A complex data type
   - [x] A single occurrence of an entity

3. What do entity types consist of?
   - [ ] Tables with dissimilar attributes
   - [x] Tables with similar attributes
   - [ ] Tables with foreign keys only
   - [ ] Tables without primary keys

4. What is the primary purpose of a primary key?
   - [ ] To store textual data
   - [ ] To link multiple tables
   - [x] To uniquely identify a record
   - [ ] To define foreign key relationships

5. How are primary and foreign keys related?
   - [ ] Primary keys are used to define foreign keys
   - [ ] Foreign keys are more important than primary keys
   - [ ] Foreign keys generate primary keys
   - [x] Foreign keys link to primary keys in different tables

**Answers:**
1. ✔️ To efficiently manage related data
