## Achieving Data Integrity: Normalization

### 🔗 **Normalization: The Path to Data Integrity** 🔗

Normalization is a pivotal step in database design, enabling the easy maintenance and updating of data without redundancy. The core of relational databases is centralized, consistent data management, which normalization reinforces.

### 🔄 **Why Normalize?** 🔄

Normalization serves two critical purposes:

1. **Eliminate Data Redundancy:** By breaking down attributes into logical entities, you prevent duplicate information across tables.

2. **Ensure Logical Entities:** All related data is stored together, ensuring cohesive and logically structured databases.

### ❓ **Is Defining Entities Enough?** ❓

Simply defining entities isn't sufficient. The normalization process is crucial to determine how attributes are grouped to minimize data anomalies and ensure the database functions as intended.

### 🤕 **Issues with Non-Normalized Tables** 🤕

Non-normalized tables lead to duplicate data spread across various locations, resulting in maintenance headaches. Inconsistent data updates can occur, rendering records unreliable and inaccurate. Such tables consume more storage, slow down queries, and generate incorrect results.

### 🛠️ **Benefits of Normalization** 🛠️

Normalization resolves these issues, preventing duplicate data and optimizing database efficiency. It often involves creating additional tables to maintain data integrity.

## 📝 **Practice with Multiple Choice Questions** 📝
