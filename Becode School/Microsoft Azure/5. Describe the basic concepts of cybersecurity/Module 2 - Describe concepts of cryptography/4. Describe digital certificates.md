### **üîí What is a Digital Certificate?**

- A digital certificate is issued by a Certificate Authority (CA).
- It verifies the identity of the certificate subject (individual or entity).
- Contains subject's public key, identity information, and CA's digital signature.
- Used to ensure secure communication and prevent interception or tampering.

### **üîë Obtaining a Digital Certificate:**

1. Request: Submit identity and public key to CA.
2. Verification: CA reviews the request and identity details.
3. Issuance: CA signs the certificate with its private key.
4. Certificate: Contains subject's public key and identity information.

### **üîê Why Do We Need Digital Certificates?**

- In asymmetric encryption, public keys are shared but not verified.
- Digital certificates link identities with public keys, verified by CAs.
- Ensures that public keys are genuine and associated with the claimed identity.

### **üñ• Application of Digital Certificates: Secure Websites**

- Websites use digital certificates for secure HTTPS communication.
- A padlock icon in the browser's address bar indicates a secure connection.
- Clicking on the padlock provides additional information about the certificate.

### **üîè Digital Signatures and Certificates**

- Digital certificates enhance digital signatures' authenticity.
- Certificates verify the sender's identity and authenticity of the message.
- Digital signatures signed with private keys ensure message integrity.
