# Mastering Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in Azure AD üîê

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) takes security up a notch by requiring multiple forms of verification. This makes it incredibly challenging for hackers to breach an identity, even if they've obtained the password.

MFA enhances security while keeping things user-friendly. It involves:

1. **Something You Know**: Like a password or PIN.
2. **Something You Have**: Such as a trusted device (phone or hardware key).
3. **Something You Are**: Biometrics (fingerprint or face scan).

Azure AD's MFA seamlessly integrates into the sign-in process, adding an extra layer of protection. Users select from registered verification methods when prompted. Admins can mandate specific methods, and users can manage their chosen methods via MyAccount.

The following methods are compatible with Azure AD MFA:

- **Microsoft Authenticator App**: Turns your phone into a strong, passwordless credential.
- **Windows Hello for Business**: Marries device-based keys with biometrics for strong authentication.
- **FIDO2 Security Key**: An unphishable passwordless authentication method.
- **OATH Hardware Token**: A key fob generating one-time password codes.
- **OATH Software Token**: Applications generating OTP codes.
- **SMS** and **Voice Call**: Text message or voice call verification.

**Security Defaults and MFA**:

Security Defaults are Microsoft's recommended basic security measures. They enforce MFA for all users, make administrators use MFA, and require MFA when necessary. They're a cost-free way to enhance security, ideal for starters or those on the free Azure AD tier. Premium license holders or complex security needs might explore other options.


Remember, MFA is your fortress against breaches. It safeguards identities while ensuring smooth user experiences.
