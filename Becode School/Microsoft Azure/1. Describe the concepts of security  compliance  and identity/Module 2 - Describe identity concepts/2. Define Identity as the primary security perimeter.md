# Identity as the Primary Security Perimeter

The landscape of digital collaboration has transformed. Today, employees and partners require access to organizational resources from anywhere, using any device, without compromising productivity. With the rise of remote work, this trend has accelerated.

**üåê The New Perimeter:**
The security perimeter no longer confines itself to on-premises networks. It now expands to:

- üåê **SaaS Applications:** Business-critical tasks hosted outside the corporate network.
- üì± **Personal Devices:** Employees' own devices for remote work (BYOD "Bring Your Own Device").
- üîå **Unmanaged Devices:** Devices used by partners or customers for corporate interaction.
- üåê **IoT Devices:** Internet of Things devices within the corporate network and customer sites.

The traditional perimeter-based security approach falls short. Instead, **Identity** emerges as the new security perimeter, safeguarding organizational assets.

### Understanding Identity

An **identity** encompasses defining traits. Think of it as the characteristics that uniquely describe someone or something. For instance, a person's identity includes authentication info like username, password, and authorization level. This applies to users, applications, devices, and more.

### The Four Pillars of Identity Infrastructure

Building a robust identity infrastructure involves four pillars:

1. **Administration:** Managing identities for users, devices, and services. Administrators oversee identity changes and governance.

2. **Authentication:** This pillar deals with how much an IT system needs to verify an identity's authenticity. It involves challenging an entity for legitimate credentials.

3. **Authorization:** Determining the access level an authenticated entity has within applications or services.

4. **Auditing:** Tracking actions ‚Äì who did what, when, where, and how. Auditing includes detailed reporting, alerts, and governance.

Addressing these four pillars holistically creates a strong identity and access control solution.
