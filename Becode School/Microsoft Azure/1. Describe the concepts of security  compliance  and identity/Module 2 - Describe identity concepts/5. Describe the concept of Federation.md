# Federation: Breaking Boundaries 🌐

## Access Beyond Borders

Federation is like an international friendship pact for the digital world. It lets different places, like organizations or domains, trust each other's citizens (users) without making them carry separate passports (usernames and passwords).

🌍 **How It Works**

Imagine Domain A and Domain B as neighboring countries. People from Domain A want to visit the cool website in Domain B. But, do they need a new set of keys (username and password) for every place they visit? Nope! That's where federation steps in.

1. **Website in Domain A**: It's like a fancy place with its own rules. It uses Identity Provider A (IdP-A) to check visitors' identities.

2. **User from Domain B**: Our traveler wants to explore this place. They have their own Identity Provider B (IdP-B) that can vouch for them.

3. **Trust Is Born**: IdP-A and IdP-B decide to trust each other. They create a trust relationship. It's like two countries agreeing on visa-free travel.

4. **Seamless Access**: When our traveler provides their details to the website, it's like showing their "trusted traveler" card. The website trusts them, thanks to the trust between the identity providers.

👯‍♀️ **One-Way Street**

Remember, trust isn't always mutual. IdP-A might trust IdP-B, but the feeling might not be returned. So, Domain A might let folks from Domain B in, but it might not work the other way around.

🚀 **Real-World Example**

Think of logging into a website with your social media account. The website (Domain A) trusts the identity provider (IdP-A), like Azure AD. If you use your Twitter account (Domain B) to log in, it's like using a "social media passport" thanks to the trust between Azure AD and Twitter.
