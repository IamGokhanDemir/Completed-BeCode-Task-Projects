# A Secure Approach

The Zero Trust model reimagines security by assuming that everything operates in an open and untrusted network, even elements behind corporate firewalls. This approach is rooted in the principle of "trust no one, verify everything." üö´üîí

Conventional security methods have limitations, and attackers can bypass them. Zero Trust counters this by no longer relying solely on the corporate network's integrity. Instead, security is fortified through rigorous measures.

In practice, this means that passwords alone aren't enough; multi-factor authentication is added for stronger verification. Access isn't granted to all devices on the network; instead, users only access specific applications or data they require. üë§üîëüì±

## Principles of Zero Trust

1. **Verify Explicitly**: Always authenticate and authorize based on various factors like user identity, location, device, data classification, and anomalies. No assumptions; every point is verified.

2. **Least Privileged Access**: Limit user access through just-in-time and just-enough access (JIT/JEA), adaptive policies, and data protection. This secures both data and productivity.

3. **Assume Breach**: Segment access by network, user, devices, and applications. Employ encryption to safeguard data and use analytics to detect threats and enhance security.

## Foundational Pillars of Zero Trust

The Zero Trust model rests on six core pillars that work together for comprehensive security:

1. **Identities**: Verify identities with strong authentication and follow the principle of least privilege access. This applies to users, services, and devices.

2. **Devices**: Monitor device health and compliance to reduce the attack surface as data moves between devices, on-premises workloads, and the cloud.

3. **Applications**: Discover all applications in use, manage permissions, and ensure secure access. Protect data consumption points.

4. **Data**: Classify, label, and encrypt data based on attributes. Ultimate security efforts are aimed at safeguarding data, both within and beyond organizational control.

5. **Infrastructure**: Assess version, configuration, and access, and use telemetry to detect attacks and anomalies. Automatically counter risky behavior.

6. **Networks**: Implement deep segmentation, real-time threat protection, end-to-end encryption, monitoring, and analytics for enhanced security.

Adopting the Zero Trust model, encompassing its principles and pillars, empowers organizations to deliver and enforce security across all fronts. üè∞üõ°Ô∏è
