# Protecting What Matters

Defense in depth is like building a fortress with multiple layers of protection, instead of relying on just one wall. 🏰 This strategy makes it really hard for attackers to breach your defenses. Let's break it down:

### Layers of Security 🛡️

1. **Physical Security**: Only authorized folks can enter sensitive areas, like a datacenter. 🚪
2. **Identity and Access Control**: Use things like passwords and extra verification steps (multifactor authentication) to control who accesses what. 🔒
3. **Perimeter Security**: Keep your corporate network safe from massive attacks by using filters (DDoS protection). 🌐
4. **Network Security**: Keep different parts of your network isolated and control communication. 🌐
5. **Compute Layer Security**: Lock down access to virtual machines (cloud-based computers) by closing unnecessary doors. 🖥️
6. **Application Layer Security**: Ensure your apps are safe from sneaky attacks. 📱
7. **Data Layer Security**: Manage who gets to see sensitive info and keep data encrypted. 🔐

### Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA) 🔐🔍🌐

Remember CIA, but not the spy agency! 😄 It's about your data:

1. **Confidentiality**: Keep secrets safe. Encrypt data and guard the keys. 🤐
2. **Integrity**: Keep data accurate. Ensure it doesn't change without permission. ✅
3. **Availability**: Make sure data is there when needed. Balancing security with access. 🔄

### Cybersecurity: Our Shield 🛡️🚀

Cybersecurity is our superhero cape against cyber villains! Our goal is to protect data's secrets, accuracy, and availability. Bad guys want the opposite, but we've got the tech to safeguard systems, networks, apps, and data. 💪

### Quick Check ❓

1. What's the main idea behind defense in depth?
	- The main idea is to use multiple layers of security instead of relying on a  single defense
2. Give an example of physical security.
	- Limiting access to a datacenter only for authorized personnel
3. What does the "CIA triad" stand for, and why is it important?
	- CIA stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. It's important because it outlines the key goals of a cybersecurity strategy.
4. Why is availability important for data?
	- Availability ensures that data is accessible when needed by the right people
5. What's the goal of cybersecurity?
	- The goal is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems, networks, applications, and data.
