## üõ°Ô∏è Defending Against DDoS Attacks with Azure DDoS Protection

In today's digital world, every organization is at risk of network attacks. üéØ Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, with their ability to overwhelm resources, are a common threat. Azure DDoS Protection is here to safeguard against these risks.

### üí° DDoS Attack Basics:

- **Aim**: DDoS attacks overload applications and servers, affecting real users.
- **Targets**: Any internet-accessible device can be hit.
- **Types**:
  - **Volumetric Attacks**: Flooding networks with huge traffic.
  - **Protocol Attacks**: Exploiting protocol vulnerabilities.
  - **Application Layer Attacks**: Disrupting data transmission.

### üõ°Ô∏è Introducing Azure DDoS Protection:

- **Function**: It scans traffic, discarding potential DDoS attacks.
- **Defends**: Blocks attackers while allowing genuine user traffic.
- **Scale**: Leverages Microsoft's global network, scaling Azure during attacks.
- **Smart Cost Management**: Adjusts network load based on actual usage.
