# üõ°Ô∏è Safeguard Your Azure Resources with Network Security Groups (NSGs)

Network Security Groups (NSGs) are your go-to defenders for protecting Azure resources within virtual networks. Think of NSGs as traffic bouncers - they filter and control inbound and outbound network traffic, ensuring only the right connections get through.

## ‚öôÔ∏è NSG Basics:

- **What**: NSGs filter traffic for Azure resources like virtual machines.
- **Where**: Each subnet and network interface can have an NSG, and one NSG can span multiple subnets.
- **How**: NSGs consist of security rules that define allowed/denied traffic based on properties like source/destination, protocol, and port.

## üìä Inbound and Outbound Rules:

- **Inbound**: Decide what traffic can enter your resources.
- **Outbound**: Control what traffic can leave your resources.

## üìù Rule Properties:

1. **Name**: A unique description of the rule's purpose.
2. **Priority**: Processing order (lower values first).
3. **Source/Destination**: IP addresses, ranges, service tags, or app security groups.
4. **Protocol**: TCP, UDP, ICMP, or Any.
5. **Direction**: Inbound or outbound.
6. **Port Range**: Specify individual or a range of ports.
7. **Action**: Allow or Deny when rule is matched.

## üß© NSG Example:

- **Default Inbound Rules**:
  1. AllowVNetInBound: Allows any VNet to VNet traffic.
  2. AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound: Permits Azure Load Balancer traffic.
  3. DenyAllInBound: Denies all other inbound traffic.

- **Rule Processing**: Lowest priority (highest number) matches first.

## üõë Comparison: NSGs vs. Azure Firewall:

1. **NSGs**: Filter traffic within virtual networks.
   - Segregate resources within VNets.
   - Distributed network layer filtering.
   - Great for traffic control within a VNet.

2. **Azure Firewall**: Centralized network firewall.
   - Protects across subscriptions and VNets.
   - Application-level filtering.
   - Provides defense-in-depth security.

## üìö Quick Quiz:

1. What is the primary function of Network Security Groups (NSGs)?
   - [ ] Creating virtual networks.
   - [ ] Managing Azure subscriptions.
   - [x] Filtering network traffic for Azure resources.

2. How do NSGs help in controlling traffic?
   - [ ] By adding more network interfaces.
