## Learning Objectives üìö

Maltego is your go-to open-source intelligence and graphical link analysis tool for investigative tasks. In this guide, you'll discover how it aids in OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) and WEBINT (Web Intelligence) by gathering and connecting information efficiently.

### OSINT vs. WEBINT ü§î

OSINT provides valuable intelligence by collecting unstructured data from various sources. However, analyzing and structuring this data can be time-consuming. WEBINT steps in to efficiently identify the intelligence available through OSINT by organizing and normalizing unstructured information found on the internet. This is where Maltego excels!
