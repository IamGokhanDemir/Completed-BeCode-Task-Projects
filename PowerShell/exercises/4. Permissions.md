**Exercise: PowerShell Permissions**

Now that we can navigate and create files, we should learn how to change permissions on these files. We will use the commands `Get-Acl`, `Set-Acl`, and `RunAs`.

- Create a file:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType File -Name myfile.txt
```

Explanation: The `New-Item` command is used to create a new item in the file system. By specifying the `-ItemType` parameter as `File`, we create a new file named `myfile.txt`.

- Check the owner and the groups:

```powershell
Get-Acl myfile.txt | Select-Object Owner, Group
```

Explanation: The `Get-Acl` command is used to retrieve the access control list (ACL) of a file or folder, which contains information about the owner and groups associated with the file. The `Select-Object` command is used to display specific properties of the ACL, in this case, the `Owner` and `Group` properties.

- Change the file owner to the built-in administrator:

```powershell
$adminAccount = "Administrator"
$filepath = "C:\path\to\myfile.txt"
$sec = Get-Acl -Path $filepath
$sec.SetOwner([System.Security.Principal.NTAccount]$adminAccount)
Set-Acl -Path $filepath -AclObject $sec
```

Explanation: In this code snippet, we first specify the name of the built-in administrator account (`$adminAccount`) and the file path (`$filepath`). Then, we use the `Get-Acl` command to retrieve the ACL of the file. Next, we set the owner of the ACL to the specified administrator account using the `SetOwner` method. Finally, we use the `Set-Acl` command to apply the modified ACL to the file.

- Check the file's permission:

```powershell
Get-Acl myfile.txt | Select-Object AccessToString
```

Explanation: Similar to the previous command, we use the `Get-Acl` command to retrieve the ACL of the file. The `Select-Object` command is used to display the `AccessToString` property of the ACL, which represents the file's permission settings in a string format.

- Try to print the content of the file as your normal user:

```powershell
Get-Content myfile.txt
```

Explanation: The `Get-Content` command is used to retrieve and display the content of a file. In this case, we are attempting to read the content of the `myfile.txt` file using the current user's permissions.

- Print the content of the file using the administrator account:

```powershell
Start-Process powershell.exe -Credential $adminAccount -ArgumentList "Get-Content C:\path\to\myfile.txt"
```

Explanation: This command launches a new PowerShell process with the specified administrator account (`$adminAccount`) using the `Start-Process` command. We pass the `Get-Content` command with the file path as an argument (`C:\path\to\myfile.txt`). This allows us to read the content of the file with the elevated privileges of the administrator account.

> **WARNING**: This exercise will only work on Windows systems since file system permissions are not managed the same way on Windows and Linux.
